                        <p class="mb-3">Here's why: Your resume looks like everyone else's. Generic bullets, task-based descriptions, no measurable impact. It gets filtered by ATS or lost in a stack of 1,000 identical resumes.</p>

                        <p>The degree proves you can learn hard things. But landing the job requires a completely different skill set—resume positioning, interview storytelling, strategic targeting. Engineering school doesn't teach any of that. <strong>That's the gap I close.</strong></p>
