                            <p>Here's how I think about it: Without coaching, you might figure things out in 2-3 years through trial and error. With coaching, you could get there in 6-12 months with a proven strategy. The question isn't whether coaching is worth it—it's whether your time is worth it.</p>
                            <p>Plus, one promotion typically pays for years of coaching. If I help you get promoted 12 months faster, that's 12 extra months of higher salary.</p>

                            <p>Not at all. Actually, the earlier you start, the better. Building a strong resume, learning how to interview, and understanding what companies actually look for—these are skills that compound over time.
