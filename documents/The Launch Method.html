    <h1>The Launch Method: Phase 1 - The Foot in the Door</h1>
    <p>Based on your brain dump, here are the three proprietary pillars we can teach your clients:</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>1. The "Me-in-We" Extraction</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Most students/juniors list "Team Capstone Project" and describe what the team built.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You forced a distinction between the project's success and your contribution.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> We teach clients to strip away the "We."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Even if it was a team effort, the resume bullet point must describe the specific gear they designed, the code they committed, or the analysis they ran.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The "Passion Proof":</strong> We use your "Voluntary Research" concept. We tell clients: "Don't just list the class; list the extra thing you did that wasn't required."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>That is the "Skin in the Game" indicator.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>2. The "Universal Translator" Technique (The DOT -> Deere Pivot)</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Candidates get pigeonholed. A Civil Engineer can't get a Mechanical job because the recruiter doesn't understand "Highway Design."</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You looked at your Iowa DOT experience and realized the content didn't matter, the competency did.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> We teach clients to perform a "Jargon Audit."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a word is specific to their old industry (e.g., "pavement gradation"), they must delete it and replace it with the universal engineering competency (e.g., "data-driven material analysis" or "compliance verification").</li>
            <li>This turns a niche candidate into a universal hire.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>3. The "Pattern Interrupt" Mindset</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Candidates are submissive. They wait to be picked.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> The Career Fair story. You didn't ask for a job; you framed them as the ones losing out.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> This isn't just about being cocky; it's about Confidence Calibration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We teach clients to view themselves as an asset to be acquired, not a beggar asking for a favor.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h1>The Launch Method: Phase 2 - The Impact Equation</h1>
    <p>We will teach your clients that a resume is not a "list of duties"; it is a <strong>Competency Evidence Locker</strong>.</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>1. The Mindset Shift: The Pyramid of Value</h2>
        <p>You mentioned a "pyramid" of candidate quality. We can visualize this for your clients to show them why they are getting rejected.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bottom Tier (The "Doer"):</strong> Lists tasks. ("Maintained spreadsheets.") -> <em>Result: Ignored.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Middle Tier (The "Achiever"):</strong> Lists results. ("Maintained spreadsheets for 3 projects.") -> <em>Result: Considered.</em></li>
            <li><strong>Top Tier (The "Launch to Lead" Standard):</strong> Lists Impact + Validation. ("Automated tracking for 3 major programs, saving 85% time and enabling daily executive visibility.") -> <em>Result: Hired.</em></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>2. The Formula: The 4-Part Bullet Framework</h2>
        <p>We will give your clients a literal template to fill in. This takes the guesswork out of writing.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>The Formula:</strong><br>
            [The Accomplishment] + [The Evidence/Metric] + [The "How" (Process)] + [The "Why" (Impact)]
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Accomplishment:</strong> What did you actually deliver?</li>
            <li><strong>The Evidence:</strong> How do I know it's real? (Numbers, $, Time, Volume).</li>
            <li><strong>The How:</strong> Prove you didn't fluff it. (Specific tools, scripts, APIs, methodologies).</li>
            <li><strong>The Why:</strong> Why does the boss care? (Visibility, speed, cost, reliability).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>3. The "Boring to Booming" Transformation</h2>
        <p>We will use your exact example in your coaching materials. It is perfect because every engineer has done "boring" data entry.</p>
        
        <table class="comparison-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>The "Task" (Boring)</th>
                    <th>The "Impact Equation" (Launch to Lead Style)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>"Maintained spreadsheets for test results."</td>
                    <td>"Solely managed data for 3 major programs (Scale) across a 10-person team, handling 100 daily tests (Metric). Wrote a custom Python script touching the Azure DevOps API (The How) to automate tracking, cutting maintenance time by 85% and enabling daily executive reporting (The Why)."</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <h1>The Launch Method: Phase 3 - The High-Contrast Interview</h1>
    <p>We will teach your clients to stop "answering questions" and start "delivering evidence."</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>1. The "Competency Radar" & The Strategic Pause</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Nervous talking to fill silence. Answering the literal text of the question rather than the subtext.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You take 1-2 minutes to "scan" for the hidden competency (the real question) before speaking.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Power Pause."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We teach clients that silence is a power move. It shows confidence, not confusion.</li>
            <li>We provide scripts for this: <em>"That is a great question. Let me take a moment to structure my thoughts so I can give you the most relevant example."</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The "Wrap-Around":</strong> We teach the transparency technique—asking to come back to a question or clarifying the intent. This frames the interview as a collaboration, not an interrogation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>2. The "Paint the Pain" Narrative (The 'S' in STAR)</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Candidates gloss over the situation ("We had a bug").</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You emphasize the pain to make the cure look valuable.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "High-Contrast Storytelling."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The bigger the monster, the bigger the hero. We teach clients to describe the "Situation" in terms of risk, cost, or stress.</li>
            <li><strong>Weak:</strong> "The code was slow."</li>
            <li><strong>Strong:</strong> "The code latency was threatening our SLA with a major client, risking a $50k contract penalty."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>3. The "Signposted" Action (The 'A' in STAR)</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Rambling, jumping back and forth in time.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> "I will take you through the 7 actions I took."</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Numbered Roadmap."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We teach clients to open their Action section with a number.</li>
            <li>It forces the interviewer to listen for that structure and keeps the candidate from getting lost.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>4. The "3-Tier Impact Ladder" (The 'R' in STAR)</h2>
        <p>This is your Golden Nugget. This is the difference between a hire and a "strong hire."</p>
        
        <table class="level-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Level</th>
                    <th>The Result</th>
                    <th>The Signal to Employer</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

                <tr>
                    <td>Level 1</td>
                    <td>The Direct Fix: "I solved the problem."</td>
                    <td>"I am a competent worker."</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Level 2</td>
                    <td>The System Upgrade: "I automated it so it won't happen again."</td>
                    <td>"I think about efficiency/process."</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Level 3</td>
                    <td>The Multiplier (The King): "I trained the team/evangelized the solution."</td>
                    <td>"I am a future leader/force multiplier."</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <h1>The Launch Method: Phase 4 - The "Iceberg" Protocol</h1>
    <p>We teach your clients that the interview is just the tip of the iceberg. The 90% below the surface is where the job is won.</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>1. The "Data Excavation" Manuscript</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Candidates rely on memory and vague bullet points. They forget details under pressure.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You write every detail (STAR) down in extreme depth before editing.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Master Manuscript."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We force clients to write a "brain dump" document. By writing the "extreme detail," they discover angles they didn't know they had.</li>
            <li>This creates a database of raw material that can be adapted to any competency.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>2. The "5-Star" Quality Filter</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Candidates tell "average" stories.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You ruthlessly rate stories. 3 stars get cut. Only 4 and 5 stars make the cut.</p>
        <p><strong>The Framework:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 Stars (The Minimum):</strong> "I did the task assigned." (Discard).</li>
            <li><strong>4 Stars (The Stretch):</strong> "I went above and beyond the core duty." (Keep).</li>
            <li><strong>5 Stars (The Rock Star):</strong> "I expanded my influence, trained others, and created a multiplier effect." (Gold).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>3. The "Matrix Mapping" & Spaced Repetition</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Cramming the night before.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> Frequency > Duration. 2 stories per competency.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Competency Matrix."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We create a grid for clients: Employer Competencies on the X-axis, Your 5-Star Stories on the Y-axis.</li>
            <li>Ensure every competency has at least two 5-Star stories mapped to it.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>4. The "Boardroom Brief" (The Binder Strategy)</h2>
        <p>The Killer Differentiator: You don't just show up; you bring props.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Cheat Sheet:</strong> A transparent, bulleted list. You ask permission to use it (shows humility and preparation).</li>
            <li><strong>The Visual Aid Binder:</strong> Tabs, charts, and visuals. You hand this to the interviewers.</li>
            <li><strong>Why it works:</strong> It engages their eyes, not just their ears. It proves you are an "engineer who documents," not just a "talker."</li>
