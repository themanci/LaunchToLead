    <h1>The Accelerate Method: Phase 1 - The Visibility Pyramid</h1>
    <p>We will teach your clients that promotion is not a reward for hard work; it is a byproduct of Influence.</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h3>Level 1: The "Competence Entry Fee"</h3>
        <p>The Hard Truth: "Performance is not the differentiator; it is the prerequisite."</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> We teach clients that before they try any "politics," they must be bulletproof in their core role.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you miss a deadline, Level 4 doesn't matter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 2: The "Skip-Level Echo"</h3>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Your direct manager might be busy, incompetent, or threatened by you.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You ensure the "Manager's Manager" (Grand-boss) sees the data.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "Organic Broadcasting." You don't brag; you "update."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We teach clients to volunteer for the demo, write the summary email that gets forwarded up, or ask the Grand-boss a strategic question in a town hall.</li>
            <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> If your boss gets hit by a bus, does the Grand-boss know your name? If no, you are invisible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 3: The "Bias Lever" (The Human Element)</h3>
        <p><span class="concept-label">The Concept:</span> "People hire people, not resumes."</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You convert "Professional Awareness" into "Personal Attachment."</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Relatability Factor."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We teach clients to move the conversation from "Project Status" to "Life & Goals."</li>
            <li><strong>The Result:</strong> When your name comes up in a calibration meeting, they don't picture a spreadsheet; they picture you. This triggers the "affinity bias" in your favor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Level 4: The "Genesis Protocol" (Making It Exist)</h3>
        <p><span class="concept-label">The Concept:</span> This is the God Tier. You don't wait for a job opening; you influence leaders to create one for you.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Speculative Pitch."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Because you have the relationships (L3) and the trust (L2), you can say: "I see a gap in how we handle X. If I took ownership of that, we could save Y."</li>
            <li>Suddenly, a new Senior Role is created just for you.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h1>The Accelerate Method: Phase 2 - The Promotion Protocol</h1>
    <p>We will teach your clients that a promotion is not something you "get"; it is a new contract you negotiate by offering more value.</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>1. The "Mastery Threshold" (The 85% Rule)</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Premature asking. Junior employees ask for a promotion because they have been there for 12 months, even if they are still struggling.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You never spoke a word about promotion until you had extracted 85-90% of the learning from the current role.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Green Light Audit."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We give clients a checklist. Are you the go-to person? Can you do the job in your sleep? Have you automated your core tasks?</li>
            <li>If not, you don't ask. You work.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>2. The "Service-Based Ask" (The Script)</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> The "Greed Pitch" ("I want more money/title").</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You framed it as a desire for Impact, Influence, and Responsibility.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Impact Proposal." We teach clients to ban the word "Promotion" from the initial conversation.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Bad:</strong> "I need a raise."</p>
            <p><strong>Launch to Lead Style:</strong> "I feel I’ve mastered my current scope. I am looking for more responsibility so I can solve [Bigger Problem] for the team. What does the gap between my current output and that level look like?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>3. The "Gap Analysis" Contract</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Vague feedback ("Keep doing what you're doing").</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You asked for specific criteria and then worked "relentlessly" toward them.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Promotion Contract."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You force the manager to define the finish line. Once they list the 3 things you need to do, you go do them.</li>
            <li>It turns a subjective decision into an objective checklist.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>4. The "Continuous Campaign"</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> The "Annual Review Lottery."</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You didn't wait for HR cycles. You brought it up whenever relevant.</p>
        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> By the time the Annual Review happened, the promotion was already a foregone conclusion.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>The Accelerate Method: Phase 3 - The Strategic Expansion</h1>
    <p>We will teach clients how to expand their territory without losing their fortress.</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>1. The "Not My Job" Funeral</h2>
        <p><strong>The Mindset:</strong> We teach clients to eliminate "That's not my job" from their vocabulary.</p>
        <p><strong>The Shift:</strong> Replace it with "The Team Success Metric." If the team fails, you fail. If the team succeeds, you have a claim to that success.</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> When a gap appears (e.g., a project is stalling), you step in. Not as a servant, but as a Stabilizer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>2. The "Quality Firewall" (The Safety Mechanism)</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Ambition leading to mediocrity. Taking on 120% workload and delivering 80% quality on everything.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You only took on extra scope if your core performance remained at an "A" level.</p>
        <p><strong>The Rule:</strong> "Core First, Expansion Second." We teach clients that a drop in core performance is a "Stop Sign."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If your main deliverables slip, you must drop the extra scope immediately.</li>
            <li>Being a "weak performer with a lot of tasks" is the death of a career.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>3. The "Silent Martyr" Prevention</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Hoping the boss notices your sacrifice.</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You coupled the work with Awareness (referencing back to the Visibility Pyramid).</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Scope Beacon." You don't just "do" the extra task; you communicate it.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Wrong:</strong> Fixing the database silently at night.</p>
            <p><strong>Right:</strong> Sending a note: "I noticed the database was lagging, so I jumped in and optimized the index to ensure the team hits the Friday deadline."</p>
            <p><em>(This signals: I saw a problem, I took ownership, I saved the team).</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h1>The Accelerate Method: Phase 4 - The Reputation Wildfire</h1>
    <p>We will teach clients how to build a reputation that enters the room before they do.</p>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>1. The "Gravity" Detection</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Sucking up to the wrong people (e.g., the "loudest" manager vs. the "respected" one).</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You identified Power Players by Vision & Trust. Who do people look at when a hard decision is announced?</p>
        <p><span class="tactic-label">The Tactic:</span> "The Gravity Audit."</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We teach clients to observe town halls and difficult meetings.</li>
            <li>The leaders who set the tone—even if they aren't in your direct chain—are the ones you need to cultivate.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>2. The "Reference Nudge" (The Trojan Horse Reference)</h2>
        <p><span class="label">The Problem:</span> Asking a leader to "go put in a good word for me" (Weak/Desperate).</p>
        <p><span class="method-label">Your Method:</span> You ask permission to use them as a reference. Then, in your Thank You email to the hiring team, you drop the name.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>The Script:</strong> "I know you're making your decision soon. If it helps to get a clearer picture of my past performance, [Influential Leader Name] has offered to share their perspective on my work."
        </div>
        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> It forces the hiring manager to realize: "Wow, this candidate has the backing of [VP Name]. We need to take this seriously."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-block">
        <h2>3. The "Wildfire" Effect</h2>
        <p><span class="concept-label">The Philosophy:</span> "Companies aren't that big."</p>
        <p><span class="concept-label">The Insight:</span> Once you hit Level 3 (Relationship) with enough Gravity Leaders, you don't need to apply for jobs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your reputation creates a pull market for your skills.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
