# The Accelerate Method: Phase 1 - The Visibility Pyramid

We will teach your clients that promotion is not a reward for hard work; it is a byproduct of Influence.

## Level 1: The "Competence Entry Fee"

**The Hard Truth:** "Performance is not the differentiator; it is the prerequisite."

**The Tactic:** We teach clients that before they try any "politics," they must be bulletproof in their core role. If you miss a deadline, Level 4 doesn't matter.

## Level 2: The "Skip-Level Echo"

**The Problem:** Your direct manager might be busy, incompetent, or threatened by you.

**Your Method:** You ensure the "Manager's Manager" (Grand-boss) sees the data.

**The Tactic:** "Organic Broadcasting." You don't brag; you "update." We teach clients to volunteer for the demo, write the summary email that gets forwarded up, or ask the Grand-boss a strategic question in a town hall.

**The Goal:** If your boss gets hit by a bus, does the Grand-boss know your name? If no, you are invisible.

## Level 3: The "Bias Lever" (The Human Element)

**The Concept:** "People hire people, not resumes."

**Your Method:** You convert "Professional Awareness" into "Personal Attachment."

**The Tactic:** "The Relatability Factor." We teach clients to move the conversation from "Project Status" to "Life & Goals."

**The Result:** When your name comes up in a calibration meeting, they don't picture a spreadsheet; they picture you. This triggers the "affinity bias" in your favor.

## Level 4: The "Genesis Protocol" (Making It Exist)

**The Concept:** This is the God Tier. You don't wait for a job opening; you influence leaders to create one for you.

**The Tactic:** "The Speculative Pitch." Because you have the relationships (L3) and the trust (L2), you can say: "I see a gap in how we handle X. If I took ownership of that, we could save Y." Suddenly, a new Senior Role is created just for you.

# The Accelerate Method: Phase 2 - The Promotion Protocol

We will teach your clients that a promotion is not something you "get"; it is a new contract you negotiate by offering more value.

## 1. The "Mastery Threshold" (The 85% Rule)

**The Problem:** Premature asking. Junior employees ask for a promotion because they have been there for 12 months, even if they are still struggling.

**Your Method:** You never spoke a word about promotion until you had extracted 85-90% of the learning from the current role.

**The Tactic:** "The Green Light Audit." We give clients a checklist. Are you the go-to person? Can you do the job in your sleep? Have you automated your core tasks? If not, you don't ask. You work.

## 2. The "Service-Based Ask" (The Script)

**The Problem:** The "Greed Pitch" ("I want more money/title").

**Your Method:** You framed it as a desire for Impact, Influence, and Responsibility.

**The Tactic:** "The Impact Proposal." We teach clients to ban the word "Promotion" from the initial conversation.

**Bad:** "I need a raise."

**Launch to Lead Style:** "I feel I've mastered my current scope. I am looking for more responsibility so I can solve [Bigger Problem] for the team. What does the gap between my current output and that level look like?"

## 3. The "Gap Analysis" Contract

**The Problem:** Vague feedback ("Keep doing what you're doing").

**Your Method:** You asked for specific criteria and then worked "relentlessly" toward them.

**The Tactic:** "The Promotion Contract." You force the manager to define the finish line. Once they list the 3 things you need to do, you go do them. It turns a subjective decision into an objective checklist.

## 4. The "Continuous Campaign"

**The Problem:** The "Annual Review Lottery."

**Your Method:** You didn't wait for HR cycles. You brought it up whenever relevant.

**The Result:** By the time the Annual Review happened, the promotion was already a foregone conclusion.

# The Accelerate Method: Phase 3 - The Strategic Expansion

We will teach clients how to expand their territory without losing their fortress.

## 1. The "Not My Job" Funeral

**The Mindset:** We teach clients to eliminate "That's not my job" from their vocabulary.

**The Shift:** Replace it with "The Team Success Metric." If the team fails, you fail. If the team succeeds, you have a claim to that success.

**The Tactic:** When a gap appears (e.g., a project is stalling), you step in. Not as a servant, but as a Stabilizer.

## 2. The "Quality Firewall" (The Safety Mechanism)

**The Problem:** Ambition leading to mediocrity. Taking on 120% workload and delivering 80% quality on everything.

**Your Method:** You only took on extra scope if your core performance remained at an "A" level.

**The Rule:** "Core First, Expansion Second." We teach clients that a drop in core performance is a "Stop Sign." If your main deliverables slip, you must drop the extra scope immediately. Being a "weak performer with a lot of tasks" is the death of a career.

## 3. The "Silent Martyr" Prevention

**The Problem:** Hoping the boss notices your sacrifice.

**Your Method:** You coupled the work with Awareness (referencing back to the Visibility Pyramid).

**The Tactic:** "The Scope Beacon." You don't just "do" the extra task; you communicate it.

**Wrong:** Fixing the database silently at night.

**Right:** Sending a note: "I noticed the database was lagging, so I jumped in and optimized the index to ensure the team hits the Friday deadline." (This signals: I saw a problem, I took ownership, I saved the team).

# The Accelerate Method: Phase 4 - The Reputation Wildfire

We will teach clients how to build a reputation that enters the room before they do.

## 1. The "Gravity" Detection

**The Problem:** Sucking up to the wrong people (e.g., the "loudest" manager vs. the "respected" one).

**Your Method:** You identified Power Players by Vision & Trust. Who do people look at when a hard decision is announced?

**The Tactic:** "The Gravity Audit." We teach clients to observe town halls and difficult meetings. The leaders who set the tone—even if they aren't in your direct chain—are the ones you need to cultivate.

## 2. The "Reference Nudge" (The Trojan Horse Reference)

**The Problem:** Asking a leader to "go put in a good word for me" (Weak/Desperate).

**Your Method:** You ask permission to use them as a reference. Then, in your Thank You email to the hiring team, you drop the name.

**The Script:** "I know you're making your decision soon. If it helps to get a clearer picture of my past performance, [Influential Leader Name] has offered to share their perspective on my work."

**The Result:** It forces the hiring manager to realize: "Wow, this candidate has the backing of [VP Name]. We need to take this seriously."

## 3. The "Wildfire" Effect

**The Philosophy:** "Companies aren't that big."

**The Insight:** Once you hit Level 3 (Relationship) with enough Gravity Leaders, you don't need to apply for jobs. Your reputation creates a pull market for your skills.
