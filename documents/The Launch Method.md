# The Launch Method: Phase 1 - The Foot in the Door

Based on your brain dump, here are the three proprietary pillars we can teach your clients:

## 1. The "Me-in-We" Extraction

**The Problem:** Most students/juniors list "Team Capstone Project" and describe what the team built.

**Your Method:** You forced a distinction between the project's success and your contribution.

**The Tactic:** We teach clients to strip away the "We." Even if it was a team effort, the resume bullet point must describe the specific gear they designed, the code they committed, or the analysis they ran.

**The "Passion Proof":** We use your "Voluntary Research" concept. We tell clients: "Don't just list the class; list the extra thing you did that wasn't required." That is the "Skin in the Game" indicator.

## 2. The "Universal Translator" Technique (The DOT -> Deere Pivot)

**The Problem:** Candidates get pigeonholed. A Civil Engineer can't get a Mechanical job because the recruiter doesn't understand "Highway Design."

**Your Method:** You looked at your Iowa DOT experience and realized the content didn't matter, the competency did.

**The Tactic:** We teach clients to perform a "Jargon Audit." If a word is specific to their old industry (e.g., "pavement gradation"), they must delete it and replace it with the universal engineering competency (e.g., "data-driven material analysis" or "compliance verification"). This turns a niche candidate into a universal hire.

## 3. The "Pattern Interrupt" Mindset

**The Problem:** Candidates are submissive. They wait to be picked.

**Your Method:** The Career Fair story. You didn't ask for a job; you framed them as the ones losing out.

**The Tactic:** This isn't just about being cocky; it's about Confidence Calibration. We teach clients to view themselves as an asset to be acquired, not a beggar asking for a favor.

# The Launch Method: Phase 2 - The Impact Equation

We will teach your clients that a resume is not a "list of duties"; it is a Competency Evidence Locker.

## 1. The Mindset Shift: The Pyramid of Value

You mentioned a "pyramid" of candidate quality. We can visualize this for your clients to show them why they are getting rejected.

**Bottom Tier (The "Doer"):** Lists tasks. ("Maintained spreadsheets.") Result: Ignored.

**Middle Tier (The "Achiever"):** Lists results. ("Maintained spreadsheets for 3 projects.") Result: Considered.

**Top Tier (The "Launch to Lead" Standard):** Lists Impact + Validation. ("Automated tracking for 3 major programs, saving 85% time and enabling daily executive visibility.") Result: Hired.

## 2. The Formula: The 4-Part Bullet Framework

We will give your clients a literal template to fill in. This takes the guesswork out of writing.

**The Formula:**
[The Accomplishment] + [The Evidence/Metric] + [The "How" (Process)] + [The "Why" (Impact)]

- **The Accomplishment:** What did you actually deliver?
- **The Evidence:** How do I know it's real? (Numbers, $, Time, Volume).
- **The How:** Prove you didn't fluff it. (Specific tools, scripts, APIs, methodologies).
- **The Why:** Why does the boss care? (Visibility, speed, cost, reliability).

## 3. The "Boring to Booming" Transformation

We will use your exact example in your coaching materials. It is perfect because every engineer has done "boring" data entry.

| The "Task" (Boring) | The "Impact Equation" (Launch to Lead Style) |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| "Maintained spreadsheets for test results." | "Solely managed data for 3 major programs (Scale) across a 10-person team, handling 100 daily tests (Metric). Wrote a custom Python script touching the Azure DevOps API (The How) to automate tracking, cutting maintenance time by 85% and enabling daily executive reporting (The Why)." |

# The Launch Method: Phase 3 - The High-Contrast Interview

We will teach your clients to stop "answering questions" and start "delivering evidence."

## 1. The "Competency Radar" & The Strategic Pause

**The Problem:** Nervous talking to fill silence. Answering the literal text of the question rather than the subtext.

**Your Method:** You take 1-2 minutes to "scan" for the hidden competency (the real question) before speaking.

**The Tactic:** "The Power Pause." We teach clients that silence is a power move. It shows confidence, not confusion. We provide scripts for this: "That is a great question. Let me take a moment to structure my thoughts so I can give you the most relevant example."

**The "Wrap-Around":** We teach the transparency technique—asking to come back to a question or clarifying the intent. This frames the interview as a collaboration, not an interrogation.

## 2. The "Paint the Pain" Narrative (The 'S' in STAR)

**The Problem:** Candidates gloss over the situation ("We had a bug").

**Your Method:** You emphasize the pain to make the cure look valuable.

**The Tactic:** "High-Contrast Storytelling." The bigger the monster, the bigger the hero. We teach clients to describe the "Situation" in terms of risk, cost, or stress.

**Weak:** "The code was slow."

**Strong:** "The code latency was threatening our SLA with a major client, risking a $50k contract penalty."

## 3. The "Signposted" Action (The 'A' in STAR)

**The Problem:** Rambling, jumping back and forth in time.

**Your Method:** "I will take you through the 7 actions I took."

**The Tactic:** "The Numbered Roadmap." We teach clients to open their Action section with a number. It forces the interviewer to listen for that structure and keeps the candidate from getting lost.

## 4. The "3-Tier Impact Ladder" (The 'R' in STAR)

This is your Golden Nugget. This is the difference between a hire and a "strong hire."

| Level | The Result | The Signal to Employer |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| Level 1 | The Direct Fix: "I solved the problem." | "I am a competent worker." |
| Level 2 | The System Upgrade: "I automated it so it won't happen again." | "I think about efficiency/process." |
| Level 3 | The Multiplier (The King): "I trained the team/evangelized the solution." | "I am a future leader/force multiplier." |

# The Launch Method: Phase 4 - The "Iceberg" Protocol

We teach your clients that the interview is just the tip of the iceberg. The 90% below the surface is where the job is won.

## 1. The "Data Excavation" Manuscript

**The Problem:** Candidates rely on memory and vague bullet points. They forget details under pressure.

**Your Method:** You write every detail (STAR) down in extreme depth before editing.

**The Tactic:** "The Master Manuscript." We force clients to write a "brain dump" document. By writing the "extreme detail," they discover angles they didn't know they had. This creates a database of raw material that can be adapted to any competency.

## 2. The "5-Star" Quality Filter

**The Problem:** Candidates tell "average" stories.

**Your Method:** You ruthlessly rate stories. 3 stars get cut. Only 4 and 5 stars make the cut.

**The Framework:**

- **3 Stars (The Minimum):** "I did the task assigned." (Discard).
- **4 Stars (The Stretch):** "I went above and beyond the core duty." (Keep).
- **5 Stars (The Rock Star):** "I expanded my influence, trained others, and created a multiplier effect." (Gold).

## 3. The "Matrix Mapping" & Spaced Repetition

**The Problem:** Cramming the night before.

**Your Method:** Frequency > Duration. 2 stories per competency.

**The Tactic:** "The Competency Matrix." We create a grid for clients: Employer Competencies on the X-axis, Your 5-Star Stories on the Y-axis. Ensure every competency has at least two 5-Star stories mapped to it.

## 4. The "Boardroom Brief" (The Binder Strategy)

**The Killer Differentiator:** You don't just show up; you bring props.

**The Tactic:**

- **The Cheat Sheet:** A transparent, bulleted list. You ask permission to use it (shows humility and preparation).
- **The Visual Aid Binder:** Tabs, charts, and visuals. You hand this to the interviewers.

**Why it works:** It engages their eyes, not just their ears. It proves you are an "engineer who documents," not just a "talker."
