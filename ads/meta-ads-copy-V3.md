# CALLOUT 1: "Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?"

---

## 1A — Financial Bleed

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Every month without a job costs you $6,700. Three months = $20,000 gone. And your resume gap keeps growing.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the #1 reason you're not getting callbacks — your resume. Grab it below.

Let's be real about what's happening:
• You're sending applications into a black hole
• The "free" advice from YouTube and Reddit isn't working
• Career services gave you a template and said "good luck"
• Meanwhile you're burning $6,700 every single month

The problem isn't the job market. It's that your resume reads exactly like every other engineer's. "Assisted with project deliverables." "Utilized MATLAB for data analysis." Hiring managers have seen that line 10,000 times. They skip you in 6 seconds.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that rewrites those bullets so they actually prove your value. Specific numbers. Real impact. Clear thinking.

Karen used it. Went from zero callbacks to interviews at Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah used it. Went from anxious intern to $106K at Ford.

Same formula. It takes 30 minutes. It's free.

## 1B — System Failure

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

You did everything right. Got the degree. Did the internships. Worked your ass off. And nobody's calling you back.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes what your university never taught you — how to write a resume that actually gets you hired. Grab it below.

Here's what nobody told you: your professors taught you thermodynamics, signal processing, and fluid dynamics. They never taught you the ONE skill that determines whether you get a job or not — how to communicate your value on paper.

Think about it:
• You spent 4+ years learning to solve engineering problems
• You spent zero hours learning to write a resume that works
• And now you're surprised it's not working?

The Impact Bullet Builder is the formula that bridges that gap. It shows you exactly how to turn "Assisted with testing procedures" into a bullet point that makes a recruiter pick up the phone.

Karen's degree wasn't getting her anywhere. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone all wanted to interview her.

Sarah was stuck as an underpaid intern. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

Your degree is worth something. Your resume just isn't showing it yet.

## 1C — Self-Doubt Spiral

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

After that many rejections, you start to wonder if something's wrong with YOU. Your GPA wasn't high enough. Your internship wasn't good enough. You picked the wrong school.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that proves the problem was never you — it's your resume. Grab it below.

I've been on the hiring side. I've reviewed thousands of engineering resumes. And here's what I can tell you: the engineers getting hired aren't smarter than you. They aren't more qualified. They aren't luckier.

They know how to write a resume that communicates value. You don't. That's the entire difference.

"Assisted with project management and data collection" — that's what 95% of engineering resumes say. It tells me nothing. I skip it in 6 seconds. Not because you're bad — because your resume doesn't show me what you actually did.

The Impact Bullet Builder teaches you how to fix every single bullet point. It's a formula. Task + Metric + Method + Impact. Once you apply it, your resume stops sounding like everyone else's.

Karen thought she was the problem too. She fixed her resume with this formula. Then: interviews at Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone. She picked her dream role.

Sarah doubted herself too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

You're not broken. Your resume is. And it takes 30 minutes to fix.

## 1D — LinkedIn Shame

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Meanwhile every time you open LinkedIn, another classmate is posting "excited to announce my new role at [dream company]." And you're wondering what they have that you don't.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you exactly what they're doing differently — and it's not what you think. Grab it below.

It's not connections. It's not nepotism. It's not a better GPA.

It's their resume.

They know how to translate their experience into language that makes hiring managers stop and call them. You write "Assisted with data analysis." They write "Built automated reporting pipeline that reduced cycle time by 40%, saving 12 hours/week." Same experience. Different framing. Completely different results.

Nobody taught you this. Not your professors. Not career services. Not YouTube. The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that teaches it in 30 minutes.

Karen was watching everyone else get hired too. She applied the formula. Then she was the one posting "excited to announce" — after getting offers from Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah was falling behind too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

Your turn.

# CALLOUT 2: "Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews or offers?"

## 2A — Invisible Resume

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews, or offers?

Your resume is getting skipped in 6 seconds. That's not an exaggeration — that's how long the average recruiter spends on it.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that makes your resume impossible to skip. Grab it below.

Here's what's happening on the other side of the screen: a recruiter opens your resume. They scan the bullet points. They see "Assisted with project deliverables" and "Collaborated with cross-functional teams" — the same words they've read on the last 200 resumes. They close yours. Open the next one. You never hear back.

Your resume isn't bad. It's invisible. It sounds like everyone else's so you get treated like everyone else — ignored.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that makes every bullet point specific, quantified, and impossible to ignore. Instead of duties, you communicate impact. Instead of sounding generic, you sound like the one person they need to call.

Karen's resume was invisible too. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone were fighting to interview her.

Sarah's was invisible too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

It takes 30 minutes and it's completely free.

## 2B — Time Running Out

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews, or offers?

The longer this goes on, the harder it gets. Your resume gap is growing. Your confidence is shrinking. And more graduates are flooding the market every semester.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that stops the bleeding. It fixes your resume — the fastest lever you can pull right now. Grab it below.

Here's what's working against you:
• More graduates entering the market every month
• AI tools replacing entry-level engineering positions
• Your resume gap getting longer (and harder to explain)
• Companies raising their requirements while lowering their patience

You can't control any of that. But you can control one thing: how your resume presents you. And right now, it's presenting you the same way as everyone else — generic bullets that say nothing.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that turns those bullets into specific, measurable proof of what you can do. It takes 30 minutes. And it's the single fastest thing you can do to change your trajectory.

Karen was in a downward spiral too. She fixed her resume with this formula. Then: interviews at Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone in the same month.

Sarah was running out of time. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

The market isn't waiting. Neither should you.

## 2C — The Grind Isn't Working

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews, or offers?

You're grinding. Applying to 10, 20, 30 jobs a day. Tailoring cover letters. Refreshing your email constantly. And getting absolutely nothing back.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that stops the grind by fixing what's actually broken — your resume bullets. Grab it below.

Here's the hard truth: sending more applications with a broken resume is like pouring water into a bucket with a hole. It doesn't matter how fast you pour — nothing fills up.

Your resume bullet points are the hole.

"Assisted with testing procedures." "Utilized CAD software for design modifications." "Collaborated with team members on project goals." Every engineer writes the exact same thing. Hiring managers read these lines 500 times a week. Your resume blends in. You get skipped. And you blame yourself.

The Impact Bullet Builder plugs the hole. It's a formula that rewrites every bullet so it communicates specific, measurable impact instead of generic duties. Fix the resume first. Then the applications start working.

Karen was grinding too. She stopped and fixed her resume with this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone — all called her.

Sarah was exhausting herself. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

Stop grinding. Start fixing.

## 2D — Emotional Exhaustion

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews, or offers?

I'm going to validate something you might be feeling: this is exhausting. The endless applications. The hope every time you hit submit. The crushing disappointment of another rejection — or worse, silence. The cycle repeating over and over.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that breaks this cycle. It fixes the root cause — your resume — so you can stop throwing darts in the dark. Grab it below.

You've suffered enough. You spent 4 years earning an engineering degree. You worked your ass off. You did everything right. And now you're spending hours every day on applications that go nowhere.

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't the market, your GPA, or your experience. It's your resume. Generic bullet points that look like every other applicant's. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving to the next one.

The Impact Bullet Builder shows you exactly how to fix that. It's a formula — not motivation, not "tips," not vague advice. A formula. Apply it to every bullet point. Takes 30 minutes. Everything changes.

Karen was exhausted too. She used this formula. Then: 4 offers — including Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah was burned out too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

You've suffered enough. Let's end this.

## 3A — The One Difference

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

Same classes. Same professors. Same all-nighters. So why are they celebrating while you're refreshing your inbox?

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you the one thing they're doing differently. And it's not what you think. Grab it below.

It's not connections. It's not luck. It's not a better personality.

It's their resume.

That's it. Seriously.

They know how to turn "Assisted with project management" into "Led cross-functional redesign of testing workflow, reducing cycle time by 34% and saving $52K annually." Same experience. Different words. One gets a call. One gets ghosted.

Nobody taught you this. Your university taught you to solve differential equations, not write a resume bullet. That's not your fault. But it is your problem.

The Impact Bullet Builder is the formula that levels the playing field. It works on any experience — internships, class projects, part-time work. 30 minutes and your resume reads completely different.

Karen was getting passed over too. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone all wanted her.

Sarah was watching everyone else move ahead. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

## 3B — Unfair Game

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

You studied harder than half of them. You got better grades than some of them. And they're employed while you're stuck. It feels unfair. Because it is.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that teaches you the unfair advantage they already know — how to write a resume that sells. Grab it below.

The job search isn't a test of who's the best engineer. It's a test of who can communicate their value on paper. And your friends who are landing jobs? They figured that part out — whether they know it or not.

Their bullets say things like "Reduced defect rate by 23% by implementing automated test protocols." Yours say "Assisted with quality assurance testing." Same work. One gets interviews. One gets ghosted.

The Impact Bullet Builder is the formula that closes this gap. It doesn't require more experience or better projects. It takes what you already have and makes it sound like what it actually is — impressive.

Karen was watching everyone pass her by. She applied this formula. Then she passed all of them. Google. SpaceX. Bridgestone.

Sarah was falling behind too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

You're not less qualified. You're less visible. This fixes that.

## 3C — Group Chat Pain

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

The group chat used to be study sessions and memes. Now it's "I just accepted an offer at Tesla" and "Starting at Boeing next month." And you're typing "congrats!!" while your stomach drops.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gets you into that conversation — on the other side of it. Grab it below.

You know the worst part? You know you're just as capable as they are. You took the same exams. You passed the same classes. You even helped some of them with their homework.

But the job market doesn't grade on knowledge. It grades on how you present yourself. And right now your resume presents you as generic. Not because you are — because nobody taught you how to write it differently.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that takes your real experience and makes it read like the resume of someone companies actually fight over. It forces you to quantify impact, show results, and communicate value — in every single bullet.

Karen was watching her friends celebrate too. She applied this formula. Then: she was the one getting fought over. Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone all wanted her.

Sarah was tired of being happy for everyone else. Same formula. $106K at Ford. Now she's the one in the group chat dropping news.

## 3D — Invisible Efforts

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

You're putting in more effort than most of them. More applications. More cover letters. More late nights tailoring resumes. And they're the ones getting offers.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you why effort alone isn't working — and what to fix instead. Grab it below.

Hard work doesn't beat strategy. Your friends landing jobs aren't working harder than you. They just have resumes that work harder FOR them.

Their bullet points don't say "Responsible for data collection and analysis." They say "Designed automated data pipeline that processed 50,000+ records daily, reducing manual analysis time by 70%." That bullet does the selling for them. Yours makes a recruiter yawn.

You can keep grinding — more applications, more hours, more frustration. Or you can spend 30 minutes fixing the thing that's actually broken.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula for writing resume bullets that sell your value without you being in the room. One formula. Every bullet. 30 minutes.

Karen was working harder than everyone with nothing to show for it. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone called her in the same week.

Sarah was grinding too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

# CALLOUT 4: "50+ engineering apps, zero offers?"

---

## 4A — Wasted Degree

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

That engineering degree cost you 4+ years and up to $200K. And right now it's sitting in a drawer while you refresh your email hoping for a callback that never comes.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that makes your degree start paying for itself — by fixing the resume that's supposed to represent it. Grab it below.

"Get an engineering degree," they said. "Engineers always get jobs," they said.

Nobody told you the degree was just the entry ticket. Not the job offer. And nobody taught you how to translate 4 years of technical education into a resume that hiring managers actually want to read.

Your bullet points say "Utilized SolidWorks for mechanical design." Cool. So does every other mechanical engineering grad. You blend in. You get skipped.

The Impact Bullet Builder changes that. It's a formula that turns generic duties into quantified impact. Specific. Measurable. Memorable. The kind of bullets that make a recruiter stop and think "I need to call this person."

Karen's degree was collecting dust. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

Sarah's was going nowhere. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

## 4B — The Real Bottleneck

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

You think the problem is the job market. Or your experience. Or your GPA. It's not. The problem is 14 bullet points on a piece of paper that don't say anything.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that rewrites those 14 bullet points so they actually work. Grab it below.

I've been on the hiring side. I've reviewed thousands of engineering resumes. Want to know what 95% of them look like?

• "Assisted the engineering team with project deliverables"
• "Collaborated with cross-functional teams"
• "Responsible for data collection and reporting"
• "Utilized MATLAB for analysis"

Every. Single. One.

Hiring managers read these lines 500 times a week. They tell us nothing about YOU. What did you actually accomplish? What improved because you were there? What would have been worse without you?

The Impact Bullet Builder forces you to answer those questions in every bullet. It's a formula: what you did + what the result was + how you did it + why it mattered. Apply it once and your resume goes from invisible to undeniable.

Karen's resume used to look like the list above. She applied the formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah's too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

14 bullet points. 30 minutes. Free.

## 4C — Childhood Bedroom

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

Same childhood bedroom. Same twin bed. Same Wi-Fi password from high school. Except now you have student loans, an engineering degree on the wall, and zero job prospects.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gets you out of that room — by fixing the one thing standing between you and your first real paycheck. Grab it below.

This wasn't the plan. The plan was: graduate, get a great job, move out, start your life, make your family proud. Instead you're 23 years old applying to jobs from the same desk where you did homework in middle school.

And the worst part? When people ask "what do you do?" you don't have an answer. You just say "I'm looking" and change the subject.

Here's what's actually wrong: your resume doesn't communicate your value. You write "Assisted with design modifications" and think that's good enough. It's not. Every engineer writes that. You're invisible.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that makes you visible. Specific results. Quantified impact. Real proof you're worth hiring. 30 minutes to implement.

Karen was stuck too. Used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone. She moved on with her life.

Sarah was stuck too. Same formula. $106K at Ford. She got her own apartment the next month.

## 4D — Broken Cycle

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Apply. Hope. Refresh email. Rejection. Repeat. Apply. Hope. Refresh. Silence. Repeat. Over and over and over.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that breaks this cycle by fixing the thing that's actually causing it — your resume. Grab it below.

You've been doing the same thing for months and expecting different results. More applications. More tailored cover letters. More keywords. More LinkedIn connections.

None of it matters if your resume bullet points are generic. And they are — because nobody ever taught you to write them differently.

"Collaborated with the engineering team on design improvements." That's not a bullet point. That's a job description. Hiring managers read it and learn nothing about you. They skip you. And the cycle continues.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that breaks the cycle at the source. It rewrites every bullet so it communicates specific, measurable impact. Different input = different output. Fix the resume and the applications start working.

Karen was trapped in the same cycle. She stopped, fixed her resume with this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone all reached out.

# CALLOUT 5: "Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?"

---

## 5A — Closing Problem

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

You're getting in the door. That means your resume is good enough to get noticed. But something is falling apart between "tell me about yourself" and the offer letter.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the root cause — because the reason you can't close interviews is the same reason most engineers struggle: you can't articulate your value clearly. Grab it below.

Here's what's happening: the interviewer asks "Tell me about a time you solved a problem." You know you've solved plenty, but you can't recall a specific one. So you ramble. You give a vague answer. The interviewer writes "lacks depth" in their notes. You don't get the offer.

This isn't a confidence problem. It's a preparation problem. And it starts with your resume.

When your bullet points are vague — "Assisted with testing" — you have nothing concrete to reference in the interview. You can't tell a compelling story about something you never clearly defined.

The Impact Bullet Builder forces you to define every accomplishment in specific, measurable terms. Once it's clear on paper, it's clear in your head. And once it's clear in your head, you stop rambling and start closing.

Karen had the same problem. She used this formula. Then she walked into interviews "very well prepared and clear about my value." Result: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

Sarah couldn't close either. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

Getting interviews means you're close. This gets you the rest of the way.

## 5B — Brain Freeze

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

You finally get the interview. You prepare for hours. You walk in feeling ready. Then they ask "tell me about yourself" and your brain turns to static. You ramble. You backtrack. You walk out knowing you blew it.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that eliminates the brain freeze — by giving you a framework for knowing exactly what to say. Grab it below.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: interview confidence isn't something you're born with. It's a byproduct of knowing your own accomplishments inside and out.

Right now, your resume says "Assisted with project deliverables" — and that's all you've got. When someone asks you about it, what do you say? "Well, I, uh, helped with... the project. The deliverables. I assisted."

That's not an answer. That's a fumble.

The Impact Bullet Builder forces you to break every experience into: what you did, what measurable result it had, how you did it, and why it mattered. Once you've done that on paper, you can do it out loud. No freezing. No rambling. Just clear, specific answers.

Karen used to freeze in every interview. She used this formula. Then she described her interviews as feeling "very well prepared and clear about my value." Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone — all gave her offers.

Sarah used to ramble. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

## 5C — Drive Home Regret

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

The drive home is always the same. "Why did I say that?" "I should've mentioned the project where I..." "They're definitely not calling back." You replay every answer and cringe.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that ends the post-interview regret — because it gives you a system for knowing what to say BEFORE you walk in. Grab it below.

You're not choking because you're a bad engineer. You're choking because you've never organized your experience in a way that's easy to recall under pressure.

When your resume says "Responsible for quality assurance" — what story does that tell? None. So when an interviewer asks about it, you have nothing to pull from. You improvise. It goes badly.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that structures every accomplishment into a clear, specific statement. Once every bullet on your resume tells a real story, you have 15+ ready-made answers for any behavioral question. No improvising. No freezing. No regret on the drive home.

Karen knew the drive-home feeling. She used this formula to prepare. Her words: she went from "feeling insecure" to "very well prepared and clear about my value." Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

## 5D — So Close Yet So Far

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

That's the most frustrating place to be. You're close. You can feel it. You're getting in the door — but the door keeps closing before you can walk through.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gives you the missing piece — the ability to articulate your value so clearly that interviewers can't say no. Grab it below.

The fact that you're getting interviews means your resume is doing part of its job. It gets you noticed. But here's the problem: your resume promises something your interview can't deliver on.

Your bullets are vague enough to pass a recruiter's 6-second scan. But when a hiring manager asks you to elaborate — you can't. Because "Assisted with testing procedures" gives you nothing to elaborate ON.

The Impact Bullet Builder fixes both sides. It rewrites every bullet so your resume gets more interviews AND gives you a built-in script for what to say when you're in the room.

Karen was getting interviews too. Never converting. She used this formula. Then: she converted Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone. All of them.

Sarah was close too. Same formula. She closed Ford. $106K.

You're closer than you think. This is the final push.

## 6A — Parent Worry + Helpless

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You're watching them struggle and you don't know how to help. They did everything right — got the grades, finished the degree, did internships. And now they're stuck.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem — send it to them or grab it below.

Here's what's happening: universities teach engineering, not job searching. Career centers hand them a template and say "good luck." That's it. The gap between "educated" and "employed" isn't their fault — nobody taught them how to write a resume that actually works.

Your advice comes from a good place, but the job market has changed. "Walk in and ask for the manager" doesn't work anymore. What does work is knowing how to communicate value on paper — and there's a formula for it.

The Impact Bullet Builder shows them exactly how to rewrite their resume so recruiters actually call. It takes 30 minutes. It's free.

Karen's parents watched her struggle too. She used this formula. Then: interviews at Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone. She picked her dream role.

Sarah's parents saw the same thing. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

You can't write their resume for them. But you can send them the tool that does.

👉 Click below to get the free guide, then share it with your engineer.

## 6B — Watching Confidence Fade

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

Then you've watched it happen: the slow fade from excited graduate to defeated job seeker. Less energy. Less hope. Fewer applications. More time in their room. They're losing confidence and you can see it.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gives them something concrete to do — not motivation, not "hang in there," but a formula that fixes their resume. Grab it below and send it to them.

Here's what they need to hear (from someone other than you): the problem isn't them. It's their resume. Every engineering grad writes the same generic bullet points. "Assisted with..." "Collaborated on..." "Utilized..." Hiring managers can't tell them apart. So nobody calls.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that rewrites those bullets into specific, quantified proof of value. It takes 30 minutes. And it's the kind of concrete action that restores confidence — because they can see the difference as they do it.

Karen's parents watched her confidence fade too. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone. She walked into interviews "very well prepared and clear about her value."

Sarah's parents saw the same spiral. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

You can't fix it for them. But you can put the right tool in their hands.

## 6C — Money Anxiety

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

They're living at home. Student loans are piling up. And that $100K degree isn't doing what everyone promised it would do. You didn't invest in their education to watch them struggle like this.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that starts turning that investment around — by fixing the resume that's supposed to represent it. Grab it below and share it with them.

Here's the math nobody talks about:
• Average engineering degree cost: $50K–$200K
• Average starting salary: $80K/year ($6,700/month)
• Every month they don't have a job = $6,700 gone
• 6 months = $40,000 in lost income on top of student debt

The free advice from YouTube and career centers? It's the most expensive advice they'll ever take — because every month it doesn't work costs them $6,700.

The Impact Bullet Builder is free and it takes 30 minutes. It's a formula that fixes their resume bullets — the #1 reason engineers don't get callbacks.

Karen's family was worried about money too. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

Sarah's family too. Same formula. $106K at Ford. Student loans became manageable overnight.

This is the most helpful text you'll send them all week.

## 6D — The Advice Gap

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You want to help but you don't know what to tell them. The job market is completely different from when you were their age. Your advice feels outdated. And everything you say seems to make them more frustrated.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gives them expert-level resume help — without you having to be the expert. Grab it below and send it to them.

Here's the reality: your kid is smart. They earned an engineering degree. They can figure things out. But they're missing one specific skill that nobody taught them — how to write a resume that communicates real value to hiring managers.

Their bullet points say "Assisted with engineering project." Every applicant writes that. Hiring managers skip it. That's why nobody's calling.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that rewrites those bullets into specific, impressive, and quantified statements. "Reduced testing time by 40% by redesigning the QA workflow." That gets phone calls.

It's free. It takes 30 minutes. And it's a lot better than another awkward "have you tried networking?" conversation at the dinner table.

Karen's parents didn't know how to help either. Karen found this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

Sarah's parents felt the same way. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

Send them something useful.

# CALLOUT 7: "Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?"

## 7A — Bragging Rights Gone

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You used to brag about them. "My grandkid's an engineer." You said it with pride at every family gathering. But now they've graduated and they can't find a job. And you don't know what to tell them.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that helps — it fixes the resume that's holding them back. Grab it below and share it with them or their parents.

The job market isn't what it used to be. When you were their age, a degree meant a job. A handshake meant something. Companies came to campus and hired on the spot.

Today? They're competing against thousands online. Their resume gets 6 seconds of attention before it's skipped. And nobody taught them how to make those 6 seconds count.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that rewrites their resume so it actually stands out. Specific numbers. Real results. The kind of bullet points that make recruiters stop and pick up the phone.

Karen's grandparents used to worry too. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone all called. Now they're bragging again.

Sarah's family was worried too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

You can give them the bragging rights back.

## 7B — Different Rules

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You want to help so badly. But every time you suggest something — "Walk in and introduce yourself" / "Call the hiring manager" / "Dress sharp and show initiative" — they roll their eyes. And it hurts.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gives them the kind of help that works in today's market. Grab it below and send it to them or their parents.

Here's the thing: you're not wrong for wanting to help. You're just playing by rules that changed. Today everything happens online. Resumes are screened by software. Recruiter attention span is 6 seconds. Walking in with a handshake gets you escorted out by security.

The rules are different. But the fundamentals are the same: you need to communicate your value clearly. That's what the Impact Bullet Builder does — it's a formula that turns vague resume bullet points into specific, impressive proof of what they can do.

It's free. It takes 30 minutes. And it's the kind of concrete help that actually moves the needle — instead of advice from a world that doesn't exist anymore.

Karen's grandparents watched her struggle. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

Sarah's family too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

The best way to help is to give them the right tool.

## 7C — Worry Kept Quiet

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You don't say anything because you don't want to add pressure. But you think about it. At night. At church. Over coffee. You worry about them more than they know.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that lets you do something about it — without being the one giving unsolicited advice. Grab it below and send it to their parents to pass along.

Your grandkid is smart. They got an engineering degree — that's not easy. But the job market today is brutal. Companies get hundreds of applications for every position. And most engineering resumes look identical — generic bullet points that say nothing. So good engineers get lost in the pile.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a formula that makes their resume stand out. It rewrites every bullet point so it shows specific results, not just duties. It takes 30 minutes and it's free.

You don't have to bring it up at dinner. Just text the link to their parent. It'll get there.

Karen's grandmother worried too. Karen used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone. Grandma stopped worrying.

Sarah's family was worried too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

Sometimes the best help is the quietest.

## 7D — Legacy & Investment

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT:**

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You helped pay for that degree. Or you watched their parents sacrifice to pay for it. Either way — that investment was supposed to open doors. And right now those doors are closed.

I found a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that starts opening them — by fixing the resume that's supposed to represent all that hard work. Grab it below and share it.

$50,000 to $200,000. That's what an engineering degree costs. Four years of hard work, sacrifice, and belief in a better future. And now your grandkid is sitting at home sending applications into the void, wondering what went wrong.

Nothing went wrong with them. The problem is their resume doesn't communicate their value. It reads like every other applicant's. Hiring managers can't see what makes them special because their bullet points don't show it.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a free formula that fixes this. It rewrites every bullet point so it proves impact — real numbers, real results, real value. 30 minutes to implement.

Karen's family invested in her education too. She used this formula. Then: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone. The investment paid off.

Sarah's family too. Same formula. $106K at Ford.

Help protect the investment.
