Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

You trusted the system. Got good grades. Did the internships. Did everything "right."

Nobody told you how hard landing a job actually is.

Here's what nobody's saying out loud:
• 18-22% of engineering grads are unemployed or underemployed
• The average new grad sends 200+ applications for 3-5 interviews
• 73% report anxiety and depression tied to the job search

You don't need more applications. You need a better system.

Karen was in your exact situation. Stuck. Frustrated. Starting to doubt herself.

Then she learned what hiring managers actually look for (hint: it's not more applications).

90 days later? Offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone. She picked Google.

Imagine your parents finally stop asking "How's the job search going?" and start bragging about you to relatives instead.

"Did you hear? She's working at Google now."

That could be you.

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Let me do some quick math that might make you uncomfortable:

The average starting engineering salary is ~$80,000.
That's $6,700 per month.

Every single month you don't have that job, you're losing $6,700.

So let's do the real math:
• 3 more months of "figuring it out" = $20,000 gone
• 6 more months = $40,000 gone
• 1 year = $80,000 gone

That "free" advice from YouTube and Reddit? It's costing you a fortune.

Meanwhile:
😔 Your classmates are posting "I'm excited to announce..." on LinkedIn
😔 Your parents keep asking "How's the job search going?"
😔 You're starting to wonder if there's something wrong with YOU

There isn't. You just don't have the right system.

The market gets harder every month. AI is shrinking entry-level roles. More graduates enter the market. The barrier keeps rising.

You can't afford to wait 6 more months.

I help engineers go from stuck to interview-ready in 21 days — not 6 months.

Sarah used this system and went from intern to $106K at Ford.
Karen got 4 offers in 90 days (Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone).

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Let me be real with you:

You're not broken. You're not unemployable. There's nothing wrong with you.

You just don't have the right system.

Think about it:
• The career center gave you a resume template and said "good luck"
• Your professors taught you thermodynamics, not how to actually get hired
• Everyone says "just apply to more jobs!" (How's that working?)

You spent 4+ years and $100,000+ on an engineering degree. And nobody taught you the ONE skill that actually matters for your career — how to land the job.

That's where I come in.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I know exactly what makes companies say YES — and what makes them ghost you.

I've turned that knowledge into a 21-Day Blueprint that works:

✅ Karen was stuck, couldn't articulate her value → 4 offers in 90 days (Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone). She picked Google.

✅ Sarah was an intern worried about her future → $106K offer at Ford, accepted.

They followed the same proven system you'll learn.

Personalized 1:1 coaching. Not a generic course with 10,000 other students. YOUR resume. YOUR stories. YOUR interviews.

Imagine the look on your parents' face when you tell them you got the job.

Imagine them bragging to relatives: "Did you hear? She's working at Google now."

That's what's possible.

❌ Conflicting YouTube advice
❌ 200+ applications, no callbacks
❌ Wondering what's wrong

✓ 3 focused sessions
✓ Done WITH you, not BY you
✓ Proven: Google, SpaceX, Ford

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

I know what you've tried:

❌ Sending more applications → Still getting ghosted
❌ Watching YouTube videos → Conflicting advice, more confusion
❌ Using resume templates → Looking exactly like everyone else
❌ "Being yourself" in interviews → Still getting rejected
❌ Asking Reddit for help → "Just apply to more jobs bro"

Here's the real problem:

You're doing this completely alone.

No feedback. No one telling you what's actually going wrong. No one who's been on the other side of the hiring table.

You could spend another 6 months piecing together contradictory advice at 2am. Sending another 200 applications. Wondering what's wrong with you.

Or you could skip the trial-and-error and get a proven playbook.

My 21-Day Blueprint is different:

✅ Done WITH you, not BY you — I'm in the trenches with you, rebuilding your resume and stories together in real-time

✅ Just 3 focused 90-minute sessions — no 40-hour video course to complete alone and forget

✅ Real feedback from someone who's actually hired engineers — I know what hiring managers look for because I've been one

✅ Proven results — Karen: 4 offers in 90 days. Sarah: $106K at Ford.

You trusted the system for 4 years. Got good grades. Did the internships.

Nobody told you the system wouldn't teach you how to actually land the job.

Let me teach you what they didn't.

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Can we be honest for a second?

This isn't just about a job.

It's about everything that comes with it:

😔 You're still living in your childhood bedroom
😔 You're borrowing money from your parents
😔 You feel like a burden, not an adult
😔 Family dinners = "So how's the job search going?"
😔 You dodge the "What do you do?" question at parties
😔 Your $100K degree feels worthless sitting in a drawer

You were supposed to have your life figured out by now.

The engineering degree was supposed to guarantee a good job. That was the deal.

But here you are. Stuck. Frustrated. Starting to wonder if there's something wrong with you.

There isn't.

You just weren't taught the one skill that actually matters — how to land the job.

I help engineers become the person they thought they'd be by now:

✅ Move out. Be independent. Be an adult.
✅ Stop borrowing money and start building wealth.
✅ Answer "What do you do?" with pride.
✅ Turn "How's the job search?" into "She's working at Google now!"

Sarah was an intern worried about her future. Now she's making $106K at Ford.

Karen was stuck and frustrated. Now she picks between Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone.

The 21-Day Blueprint worked for them. It can work for you.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews or offers?

The silence is deafening.

You hit "submit" on another application. Then another. Then another.

And nothing. Just... silence.

Maybe an automated rejection email at 3am. "We've decided to move forward with other candidates."

You start to wonder:
• Is my resume even getting seen?
• Am I applying to the wrong jobs?
• Is there something about ME that's the problem?

Here's the truth no one tells you:

The average new grad applies to 200+ jobs to get 3-5 interviews. That's a 1.5-2.5% response rate.

You're not failing. The system is designed to ghost you.

But what if you could flip the script?

What if companies actually responded? What if you got multiple offers to choose from?

Karen was exactly where you are. Stuck. Silent inbox. Zero momentum.

Then she learned what I call the "Career Launch Method" — the exact system hiring managers use to evaluate candidates (I know because I was one).

90 days later, she had 4 offers on the table:
• Google
• SpaceX
• GE
• Bridgestone

She picked Google.

The silence ended. The offers started.

I help engineers go from "no callbacks" to "which offer should I accept?" in 21 days.

• AI eliminating entry-level jobs

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews or offers?

I need you to understand something important:

The job market is getting HARDER, not easier.

Every month that passes:
• More graduates flood the market
• AI tools eliminate entry-level positions
• Companies raise their requirements
• Your resume gap gets longer (and harder to explain)

That 6-month gap? Hiring managers notice. That 12-month gap? They really notice.

Time is not on your side.

Here's the math:
• Average engineering salary: $80,000/year
• That's $6,700/month
• Every month without a job costs you $6,700

6 months of "figuring it out" = $40,000 in lost income.

Plus the student loan payments. Plus the credit card debt. Plus borrowing from your parents.

The free advice from YouTube? The resume templates from Reddit?

They're not free. They're costing you thousands every month they don't work.

I help engineers get interview-ready in 21 days — not 6 months.

Sarah went from intern to $106K at Ford.
Karen went from stuck to choosing between Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone.

They didn't wait. They invested in a proven system.

The market isn't waiting for you to figure it out.

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews or offers?

Let me tell you about two engineers who were in your exact situation:

**Sarah's story:**
She was finishing an internship, terrified about what came next. No full-time offers. Watching her classmates post "I'm excited to announce..." while her inbox stayed empty.

After working with me: $106K offer at Ford. Accepted.

**Karen's story:**
She was stuck. Couldn't articulate her value. Kept getting ghosted after interviews. Starting to doubt if she was even cut out for engineering.

After working with me: 4 offers in 90 days. Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone. She picked Google.

Here's what they had in common:

They were smart. They worked hard. They did everything "right."

But nobody taught them how to actually get hired.

That's the gap I fill.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I've sat on the other side of the table. I know exactly what makes us say "yes" — and what makes us ghost you.

I've packaged that knowledge into a 21-Day Blueprint:

• 1:1 personalized coaching (not a generic course)
• Real feedback on YOUR resume, YOUR stories, YOUR interview answers

✅ **Just 3 focused sessions**
No 40-hour video course to slog through alone. Three 90-minute sessions, laser-focused on what moves the needle.

✅ **Insider knowledge**

You start to wonder:
• Am I not smart enough?
• Did I pick the wrong major?
• Is there something wrong with ME?

Let me stop you right there.

You are not the problem.

You graduated with an engineering degree. You did the hard work. You proved you can handle complex challenges.

The problem is simple: Nobody taught you how to get hired.

Your professors taught you thermodynamics and calculus. They didn't teach you how to write a resume that gets interviews. How to tell stories that land offers. How to negotiate your salary.

That's the missing piece.

I help engineers close that gap:
• From feeling "less than" to confident
• From comparing yourself to others to focusing on YOUR path
• From "no callbacks" to "which offer should I accept?"

You had similar grades. Similar projects. Similar internships.

So why are they getting offers while you're getting ghosted?

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

It's not about who's smarter or more qualified.

It's about who knows how to COMMUNICATE their value.

Your friends who are landing jobs? They're not necessarily better engineers. They're better at showing companies why they should be hired.

That's a skill. And you can learn it.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I've seen hundreds of resumes and conducted dozens of interviews. The candidates who get offers aren't always the most qualified — they're the ones who tell the right stories.

Karen couldn't articulate her value. She kept getting passed over.

After learning the system: Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone all made offers. In 90 days.

The right system can close the gap faster than you think.

Karen was stuck while her peers were getting offers. Felt like she'd never catch up.

90 days later?

While her friends were starting entry-level jobs, Karen was choosing between:

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

Let me tell you the difference between you and them:

It's not intelligence. You both passed the same classes.
It's not work ethic. You both grinded through the same projects.
It's not luck. (Well, maybe a little.)

The real difference?

They learned how to communicate their value. You didn't.

That's it. That's the whole secret.

Here's what I mean:

When a hiring manager asks "Tell me about yourself," your friend has a compelling 90-second story that positions them as the obvious choice.

You have... a rambling summary of your resume.

When they ask "Why should we hire you?" your friend connects their experience to the company's specific needs.

You give generic answers about being a "hard worker" and "team player."

Same skills. Different packaging. Wildly different results.

The good news? This is 100% learnable.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I've seen what separates the candidates who get offers from the ones who get ghosted.

I've packaged that knowledge into a 21-Day Blueprint:
• How to tell stories that make hiring managers say "yes"
• How to position your experience as exactly what they need
• How to stand out in a sea of identical resumes

Karen learned it → 4 offers in 90 days (including Google)

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

You're working just as hard as they are. Maybe harder.

You've sent hundreds of applications. Spent hours tweaking your resume. Practiced interview questions until you can recite them in your sleep.

And still... nothing.

Meanwhile, your friend who graduated with a lower GPA just posted about their new job at a company you applied to.

What gives?

Here's the frustrating truth:

Hard work without the right strategy is just... wasted effort.

You can send 500 more applications using the same resume. You'll get the same results.

You can practice 100 more interview questions. If you're practicing the wrong way, it won't help.

There's a faster path.

Instead of figuring it out through painful trial and error (like I did when I started my career), you can learn from someone who's been on the other side.

I've hired engineers. I know what makes us say yes.

The 21-Day Blueprint is that shortcut:
• 3 sessions, not 6 months of guessing

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

I know what you're feeling.

Maybe people are starting to talk. Family members asking awkward questions. Friends giving you that sympathetic look.

Maybe you're starting to doubt yourself too.

"Maybe I'm just not cut out for this."
"Maybe I should have picked a different major."
"Maybe I'm not as good as I thought I was."

Stop.

You graduated with an engineering degree. That puts you in the top tier of problem-solvers in the world.

The issue isn't your ability. It's that nobody taught you the ONE skill that actually matters after graduation: how to get hired.

You know what's better than proving the doubters wrong?

Proving them SO wrong they look foolish for ever doubting you.

Karen felt the doubt too. Then she got offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone. In 90 days.

Imagine the look on everyone's face when you announce you got hired at Google.

That aunt who kept asking "So... still looking?" Quiet.
That friend who got hired before you? Suddenly asking YOU for advice.
Those classmates with the LinkedIn posts? You're about to have a better one.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

Let me guess your strategy:

Find job posting → Slightly tweak resume → Hit submit → Repeat 50 times → Refresh inbox → Nothing → Repeat.

Sound familiar?

Here's the problem:

You're playing a numbers game you can't win.

The average engineering job posting gets 250+ applications. Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on each resume. Your carefully crafted application? It probably never got read by a human.

More applications ≠ more interviews.

Better applications = more interviews.

There's a difference between:
• A resume that gets filtered out by ATS software
• A resume that makes recruiters stop scrolling

There's a difference between:
• An application that blends in with 250 others
• An application that makes them say "we need to talk to this person"

I help engineers make that shift.

I'm a former hiring manager. I know what makes us pull a resume out of the pile. What makes us actually read it. What makes us schedule an interview.

Karen was stuck in the volume trap. Sending applications, hearing nothing.

After learning the system: 4 offers in 90 days. Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone.

Same person. Different approach. Wildly different results.

Not to scare you, but hiring managers notice gaps.

"What were you doing between graduation and now?"

At 3 months, it's fine. "I was job searching."
At 6 months, it raises questions.
At 12 months, it's a red flag you have to explain away.

The longer you're stuck, the harder it gets to get unstuck.

And it's not just the resume gap.

It's the $6,700/month you're not earning.
It's the student loans piling up interest.
It's the parents you're borrowing from.
It's the confidence draining away with every rejection.

This is a problem that compounds.

You need to fix it. Fast.

I help engineers go from stuck to interview-ready in 21 days.

Not 6 months of trial and error.
Not endless YouTube videos with conflicting advice.

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

After 50+ applications, you've probably asked yourself:

"What am I doing wrong?"

Let me tell you what it probably is:

**Problem #1: Your resume looks like everyone else's**
Same format. Same bullet points. Same generic language. Recruiters see hundreds of identical resumes. Yours doesn't stand out.

**Problem #2: You're not speaking their language**
Your resume talks about what YOU did. Hiring managers care about what you can do for THEM. Different focus.

**Problem #3: Your stories are weak**
When you get an interview, you give rambling, unfocused answers. You haven't prepared the specific stories that make companies say "yes."

**Problem #4: You're applying wrong**
Spray and pray doesn't work. Targeted, strategic applications with customized approaches do.

These are all fixable.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I've seen these mistakes thousands of times. And I've built a system to fix them.

The 21-Day Blueprint:
✅ Rebuilds your resume to stand out (done WITH you, not for you)
✅ Teaches you to speak the employer's language
✅ Helps you craft stories that land offers
✅ Shows you how to apply strategically

Karen fixed these problems → 4 offers in 90 days
Sarah fixed these problems → $106K at Ford

You're not doing anything "wrong." You just haven't been taught the right way.

I'm going to validate something you might be feeling:

This is exhausting.

The endless applications.
The hope every time you hit "submit."
The crushing disappointment of another rejection (or worse, silence).
The cycle repeating over and over.

It's not supposed to be this hard.

You spent 4 years getting an engineering degree. You worked your ass off. You did everything right.

And now you're spending hours every day on applications that go nowhere.

It's demoralizing. It's frustrating. It's lonely.

And the worst part? You don't even know what you're doing wrong.

Let me help.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I've been on the other side. I know why applications get ignored and why some get interviews.

More importantly: I know how to fix it.

The 21-Day Blueprint is designed to end this cycle:

• Done WITH you — I'm in the trenches with you, not handing you a course
• Real feedback — no more wondering what went wrong

• Countless all-nighters and stress

And right now, it's sitting in a drawer. Unused.

Every day without a job, you're not getting the ROI you were promised.

"Get an engineering degree," they said. "Engineers always get jobs," they said.

Nobody told you the degree was just the ticket to the game — not a guarantee you'd win.

You feel cheated. And honestly? You should.

The system failed you. Your university taught you thermodynamics but not how to get hired. Career services gave you a template and said "good luck."

But here's the thing:

Feeling cheated won't fix it. Action will.

I help engineers make their degrees pay off.

I'm a former hiring manager. I know what the degree is actually worth — and how to communicate that value to employers.

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

This is actually a GREAT sign.

Hear me out:

If you're getting interviews, your resume works. Companies see something in you worth exploring.

The problem isn't getting in the door. The problem is what happens once you're there.

Somewhere in the interview process, something goes wrong:
• Maybe you freeze up when they ask technical questions
• Maybe your answers ramble and lose focus
• Maybe you can't explain what makes you different
• Maybe you don't know how to close

The good news? Interviewing is a skill. And skills can be learned.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I've conducted hundreds of interviews. I know exactly when candidates lose me — and what the winners do differently.

Most people never get this feedback. They just get ghosted and wonder why.

I'll tell you why. And I'll show you how to fix it.

The 21-Day Blueprint includes:
• Mock interviews with real feedback
• Story frameworks that make you memorable
• Techniques to handle any question confidently
• How to close the interview and secure the offer

Karen was getting interviews but no offers. Then: Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone — 4 offers in 90 days.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

Let me share a secret from my years as a hiring manager:

There's a formula to interviews. Most candidates don't know it.

When we ask "Tell me about yourself," we're not looking for your life story. We're looking for a specific structure that signals "this person gets it."

When we ask "What's your greatest weakness," there's a right way and a wrong way to answer. Most people get it wrong.

When we ask behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time when..."), we're listening for a specific pattern. Hit it, you move forward. Miss it, you're out.

The candidates who get offers aren't necessarily the most qualified.

They're the ones who know the formula.

Karen was qualified. She just didn't know the formula. She kept getting interviews but no offers.

After learning the formula: Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone all made offers in 90 days.

Same person. Same qualifications. Different interview performance.

The 21-Day Blueprint teaches you:
• The exact structure for "Tell me about yourself"
• The STAR method done RIGHT (most people do it wrong)
• How to handle technical questions you don't know
• How to ask questions that make you memorable
• How to close and actually get the offer

You're already getting in the door. Let me help you close.

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

You've probably "practiced" for interviews.

Looked up common questions. Thought about your answers. Maybe rehearsed in front of a mirror.

Here's the thing:

That's not real practice. That's preparation theater.

Real practice looks like this:
• Someone asks you questions you don't expect
• You answer under pressure, with stakes
• You get honest feedback on what worked and what didn't
• You adjust and try again

Without real practice, you're walking into interviews hoping you perform well.

With real practice, you KNOW you'll perform well.

The 21-Day Blueprint includes mock interviews that feel like the real thing:
• Questions based on what companies actually ask
• Real-time pressure that simulates the actual experience
• Honest feedback (not "you did great, sweetie" from your mom)
• Iteration until your answers are bulletproof

Karen practiced. Then she got offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone.

Sarah practiced. Then she got $106K at Ford.

You can't practice alone. Well, you can — but it won't work.

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

Can I be honest about something?

Interviewers can smell desperation.

When you're nervous, it shows.
When you're unsure of yourself, it shows.
When you're worried about whether you're good enough, it shows.

And it costs you offers.

I'm not saying this to make you feel bad. I'm saying it because it's fixable.

Confidence in interviews comes from:
• Knowing exactly what you're going to say
• Having practiced until it feels natural
• Understanding what the interviewer actually wants
• Believing you deserve the job (because you do)

Most engineers are humble. You're trained to say "I don't know" when you don't know.

In interviews, that humility becomes a liability.

The 21-Day Blueprint helps you:
• Build genuine confidence through preparation
• Develop answers you can deliver without hesitation
• Learn how to project competence (even when you're nervous)
• Walk in knowing you're the right person for the job

Karen walked into her Google interview with confidence. She got the offer.

Sarah walked into Ford believing she belonged there. $106K later, she was right.

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

You're closer than you think.

Getting interviews means companies see potential in you. They're inviting you to prove yourself.

You're not starting from zero. You're at the 1-yard line.

All you need to do is punch it in.

The difference between "interview" and "offer" often comes down to small things:
• How you start your answer to "Tell me about yourself"
• Whether you have 2 good stories or 5 great ones
• If you ask smart questions at the end
• How you follow up afterward

These aren't massive changes. They're tweaks.

But they're the tweaks that separate "We'll be in touch" from "We want to make you an offer."

Karen was at the 1-yard line too. She kept fumbling.

After learning the small tweaks: Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone — 4 offers in 90 days.

Same interviews. Same companies. Different results.

And now they're stuck at home, sending applications into the void, getting rejected over and over.

You want to help, but you're not sure how. The job market has changed. Your advice doesn't seem to land.

Meanwhile, you're watching them lose confidence. Get more frustrated. Start to doubt themselves.

It's painful to watch.

Here's what I want you to know:

This isn't their fault. Universities teach engineering, not job searching. Career centers give them a resume template and say "good luck."

The gap between "educated" and "employed" is the problem — and it's fixable.

I'm Mansour, a former engineering hiring manager. I help new engineers land jobs through a 21-Day Blueprint:

• Real feedback on resumes, interviews, and strategy

Results:

• Sarah: Intern → $106K at Ford

Every month they're stuck costs ~$6,700 in lost income. Plus the toll on their confidence.

Let's talk about the investment you've made.

Four years of college. Tuition, room, board, books. Late-night phone calls about exams. Stress about their future.

Maybe it was $50,000. Maybe it was $150,000. Maybe more.

That investment was supposed to pay off with a good job.

And right now, it's not paying off.

Every month without a job:
• That's $6,700 in lost income (average engineering starting salary is ~$80K/year)
• That's student loan interest piling up
• That's your kid's confidence eroding
• That's more time they're stuck, possibly at home

You invested in their education. But nobody taught them the one skill that matters most: how to actually get hired.

That's where I come in.

I'm Mansour, a former engineering hiring manager. I created a 21-Day Blueprint specifically for this problem.

• 3 sessions, 90 minutes each
• Personalized coaching on resume, stories, interviews
• Proven results: Karen got offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone. Sarah got $106K at Ford.

Investment: $1,000 (currently 50% off from $2,000)

That's less than one month of lost income. And it solves the problem.

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

They probably haven't told you how bad it really is.

The constant rejection. The silence. The automated emails at 3am. The creeping self-doubt.

They don't want you to worry. They don't want to feel like a burden.

So they say "I'm working on it" and change the subject.

But you can see it in their eyes. The stress. The frustration. The fear that maybe they're not cut out for this.

As a parent, you want to help. But what can you do?

The job market has changed. LinkedIn barely existed when you were job searching. AI is reshaping everything. Your well-meaning advice ("Just call them!") doesn't quite land.

Here's what you CAN do:

Point them toward someone who knows the current landscape. Someone who's been on the hiring side. Someone who can teach them what they didn't learn in school.

I'm Mansour. I was an engineering hiring manager. Now I help new engineers land jobs through a 21-Day Blueprint.

Karen was stuck. Now she works at Google.
Sarah was an intern. Now she makes $106K at Ford.

You can't fix this for them. But you can give them the resource that will.

👉 Forward this to them with a note: "Hey, I saw this and thought of you."

Or book a call with me to learn more before you share it.

PARENTS:

Every month they're stuck:

• $6,700 not earned
• Confidence eroding
• Resume gap growing
• Student loans piling up

Program cost: $1,000
One month lost income: $6,700

Every month you wait
costs more than the solution.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

Every month they're stuck costs them about $6,700.

(Average engineering starting salary is ~$80,000/year. Divide by 12.)

It also costs them:
• Confidence
• Momentum
• Resume gap that gets harder to explain
• Interest accumulating on student loans

And it costs you:
• Worry
• Awkward conversations
• Possibly supporting them longer than planned

Time is the enemy here.

The longer this goes on, the harder it gets. The gap grows. The doubt sets in. The market gets more competitive.

I help engineers fix this in 21 days.

Not 6 more months of trial and error.
Not endless YouTube videos with contradictory advice.
Not more applications into the void.

3 focused sessions. A proven system. Real results.

Karen: Stuck → Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone (4 offers in 90 days)
Sarah: Intern → $106K at Ford

The math is simple:
• Program cost: $1,000
• One month of lost income: $6,700

Every month you wait costs more than the solution.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You watched them grow up. Cheered at graduations. Bragged to friends about their big engineering degree.

And now they're stuck.

They're smart. They worked hard. They did everything right.

But the job market isn't what it used to be.

When you were their age, a degree meant something. Companies recruited on campus. A firm handshake and eye contact went a long way.

Today? They're competing against thousands online. AI is changing everything. The rules are different.

Your advice ("Pound the pavement! Call the manager!") comes from a good place, but it doesn't quite fit anymore.

Here's how you CAN help:

Point them toward someone who understands this new world.

I'm Mansour. I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I help new engineers land jobs through a 21-Day Blueprint.

Results:
• Karen was stuck → 4 offers in 90 days (Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone)
• Sarah was struggling → $106K at Ford

Imagine the next family gathering:

"Did you hear? She got hired at Google!"

That could be your grandchild's story.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You've given them gifts over the years. Birthday money. Graduation presents. Maybe helped with tuition.

Here's a gift that could change their life:

The 21-Day Engineering Career Blueprint.

It's not a thing. It's a transformation.

Here's what it does:
• Teaches them how to write a resume that actually gets interviews
• Shows them how to tell stories that make companies say "yes"
• Prepares them for interviews so they walk in confident

3 sessions, 90 minutes each. Personalized coaching, not a generic course.

The result:
• Karen went from stuck to offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone
• Sarah went from intern to $106K at Ford

Current price: $1,000 (50% off from $2,000)

That's probably less than you spent on their graduation gift. But it's worth infinitely more.

It's the gift of their career actually starting.

Imagine the thank-you call:

"Grandma/Grandpa, I got the job! Thank you so much for believing in me!"

You don't have to understand LinkedIn or AI or the new job market.

You just have to believe in them enough to invest in their success.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You've been there for every milestone.

First day of school. Graduations. The proud moment they said "I'm going to be an engineer."

But this milestone — landing their first real job — is stuck.

And watching them struggle is hard.

They're sending applications. Getting rejected. Starting to doubt themselves.

You want to help, but you're not sure how. Times have changed.

Here's what I want you to know:

They're not failing. The system failed them.

Universities taught them calculus and thermodynamics. Nobody taught them how to get hired.

I fix that gap.

I'm Mansour, a former engineering hiring manager. My 21-Day Blueprint teaches new engineers exactly what companies are looking for.

The results speak:
• Karen: Stuck → 4 offers in 90 days, including Google
• Sarah: Intern → $106K at Ford

Imagine the next time you see them:

"I got the job, Grandma! I start at Google next month!"

You've been there for every milestone. You can be there for this one too.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

When you were starting out, things were different.

You could walk into a company. Ask for the manager. Hand them your resume. Get hired on the spot.

A firm handshake meant something. Loyalty was valued. A degree opened doors.

Today?

Your grandkid is competing against 500 other applicants for every job. A computer screens their resume before a human ever sees it. "Networking" happens on LinkedIn, not at Rotary Club.

The advice that worked for you doesn't quite work anymore.

But that doesn't mean you can't help.

You might not understand the new game. But you can connect them with someone who does.

I'm Mansour. I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I know exactly how companies hire today — because I've been on that side.

My 21-Day Blueprint teaches new engineers:
• How to beat the computer screening (it's called "ATS")
• How to stand out on LinkedIn
• How to interview in a way that lands offers

Karen was stuck. Now she works at Google.
Sarah was lost. Now she makes $106K at Ford.

You've always been in their corner. This is how you stay there.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

Picture the next family holiday:

Someone asks: "So how's [your grandchild] doing?"

And instead of the awkward pause...

You say: "They just got hired at Google. We couldn't be more proud."

The room goes quiet. Then everyone wants to hear the story.

"Google?! How did they manage that?"

You smile. "They worked with an incredible career coach. Turned everything around in 90 days."

That's exactly what happened for Karen's family. She was stuck. Frustrated. Sending applications into the void.

Then she learned the system that hiring managers actually look for.

90 days later: Offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone.

She picked Google.

I'm Mansour, the coach who helped her get there. And I want to help your grandkid have the same success story.
