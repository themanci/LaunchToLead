## Urgency & Scarcity Messaging

### 💰 Pricing (50% Off)
**Key Message:** "50% off — normally $2,000, now $1,000 for the first 10 clients this month"

Use variations like:
- "Currently 50% off: $1,000 (normally $2,000)"
- "$1,000 investment (50% off the regular $2,000)"
- "Less than 1 month of lost income ($6,700) to fix the problem"

### 🔒 Limited Capacity (10 Clients/Month)
**Key Message:** "I only accept 10 clients per month because every session is 1:1 and deeply personalized"

Why it's real (not fake scarcity):
- 3 sessions × 90 minutes = 4.5 hours per client
- Plus prep, follow-up, and support time
- 10 clients = ~50+ hours/month of dedicated coaching
- Quality requires limits — this isn't a course with 10,000 students

Use variations like:
- "Only 10 spots available this month (1:1 coaching means I can't take more)"
- "I limit enrollment to 10 clients/month to keep sessions personalized"
- "Spots fill fast — I can only work with 10 engineers each month"

### ✅ The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™
**Full Guarantee:** Complete all 3 sessions and do the homework, and I guarantee you will walk away with:

1. A fully transformed resume using The Impact Bullet Builder™
2. A completed Competency Story Map with 15+ STAR examples
3. At least one live mock interview with personalized feedback
4. 10x more confidence in your interviewing abilities

**If we don't achieve all of these together, I'll continue working with you at no additional charge until we do.**

Use variations like:
- "Backed by The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™ — if we don't hit all 4 deliverables, I keep coaching you for free until we do"
- "100% satisfaction guaranteed: If you don't walk away with a transformed resume, 15+ STAR stories, mock interview experience, and real confidence — I'll keep working with you at no extra cost"

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

You trusted the system. Got good grades. Did the internships. Did everything "right."

Nobody told you how hard landing a job actually is.

Here's what nobody's saying out loud:
• 18-22% of engineering grads are unemployed or underemployed
• The average new grad sends 200+ applications for 3-5 interviews
• 73% report anxiety and depression tied to the job search

You don't need more applications. You need a better system.

Karen was in your exact situation. Stuck. Frustrated. Starting to doubt herself.

Then she learned what hiring managers actually look for (hint: it's not more applications).

90 days later? Offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone. She picked Google.

Imagine your parents finally stop asking "How's the job search going?" and start bragging about you to relatives instead.

"Did you hear? She's working at Google now."

That could be you.

🔒 **I only accept 10 clients per month.** Every session is 1:1 and deeply personalized — this isn't a course with 10,000 students. Quality requires limits.

💰 **Currently 50% off:** $1,000 (normally $2,000) — less than one month of the salary you're missing out on.

✅ **The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™:** Walk away with a transformed resume, 15+ STAR stories, mock interview experience, and real confidence — or I keep coaching you for free until you do.

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Let me do some quick math that might make you uncomfortable:

The average starting engineering salary is ~$80,000.
That's $6,700 per month.

Every single month you don't have that job, you're losing $6,700.

So let's do the real math:
• 3 more months of "figuring it out" = $20,000 gone
• 6 more months = $40,000 gone
• 1 year = $80,000 gone

That "free" advice from YouTube and Reddit? It's costing you a fortune.

Meanwhile:
😔 Your classmates are posting "I'm excited to announce..." on LinkedIn
😔 Your parents keep asking "How's the job search going?"
😔 You're starting to wonder if there's something wrong with YOU

There isn't. You just don't have the right system.

I help engineers go from stuck to interview-ready in 21 days — not 6 months.

Sarah used this system and went from intern to $106K at Ford.
Karen got 4 offers in 90 days (Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone).

🔒 **Only 10 spots available this month.** I keep it small because every session is 1:1 — I'm in the trenches with you, not handing you a course.

💰 **50% off this month:** $1,000 (normally $2,000). That's less than ONE MONTH of the income you're losing.

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Let me be real with you:

You're not broken. You're not unemployable. There's nothing wrong with you.

You just don't have the right system.

Think about it:
• The career center gave you a resume template and said "good luck"
• Your professors taught you thermodynamics, not how to actually get hired
• Everyone says "just apply to more jobs!" (How's that working?)

You spent 4+ years and $100,000+ on an engineering degree. And nobody taught you the ONE skill that actually matters for your career — how to land the job.

That's where I come in.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I know exactly what makes companies say YES — and what makes them ghost you.

I've turned that knowledge into a 21-Day Blueprint that works:

✅ Karen was stuck, couldn't articulate her value → 4 offers in 90 days (Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone). She picked Google.

✅ Sarah was an intern worried about her future → $106K offer at Ford, accepted.

They followed the same proven system you'll learn.

🔒 **I only work with 10 clients per month.** This is personalized 1:1 coaching — YOUR resume, YOUR stories, YOUR interviews. Not a generic course.

💰 **Currently 50% off:** $1,000 (normally $2,000)

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

I know what you've tried:

❌ Sending more applications → Still getting ghosted
❌ Watching YouTube videos → Conflicting advice, more confusion
❌ Using resume templates → Looking exactly like everyone else
❌ "Being yourself" in interviews → Still getting rejected
❌ Asking Reddit for help → "Just apply to more jobs bro"

Here's the real problem:

You're doing this completely alone.

No feedback. No one telling you what's actually going wrong. No one who's been on the other side of the hiring table.

You could spend another 6 months piecing together contradictory advice. Sending another 200 applications. Wondering what's wrong with you.

Or you could skip the trial-and-error and get a proven playbook.

My 21-Day Blueprint is different:

✅ Done WITH you, not BY you — I'm in the trenches with you, rebuilding your resume and stories together in real-time

✅ Just 3 focused 90-minute sessions — no 40-hour video course to complete alone

✅ Real feedback from someone who's actually hired engineers

✅ Proven results — Karen: 4 offers in 90 days. Sarah: $106K at Ford.

🔒 **Only 10 spots per month** — I limit enrollment to keep sessions deeply personalized.

💰 **50% off:** $1,000 (normally $2,000)

Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Can we be honest for a second?

This isn't just about a job.

It's about everything that comes with it:

😔 You're still living in your childhood bedroom
😔 You're borrowing money from your parents
😔 You feel like a burden, not an adult
😔 Family dinners = "So how's the job search going?"
😔 You dodge the "What do you do?" question at parties
😔 Your $100K degree feels worthless sitting in a drawer

You were supposed to have your life figured out by now.

The engineering degree was supposed to guarantee a good job. That was the deal.

But here you are. Stuck. Frustrated. Starting to wonder if there's something wrong with you.

There isn't.

You just weren't taught the one skill that actually matters — how to land the job.

I help engineers become the person they thought they'd be by now:

✅ Move out. Be independent. Be an adult.
✅ Stop borrowing money and start building wealth.
✅ Answer "What do you do?" with pride.
✅ Turn "How's the job search?" into "She's working at Google now!"

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews or offers?

The silence is deafening.

You hit "submit" on another application. Then another. Then another.

And nothing. Just... silence.

Maybe an automated rejection email at 3am. "We've decided to move forward with other candidates."

You start to wonder:
• Is my resume even getting seen?
• Am I applying to the wrong jobs?
• Is there something about ME that's the problem?

Here's the truth no one tells you:

The average new grad applies to 200+ jobs to get 3-5 interviews. That's a 1.5-2.5% response rate.

You're not failing. The system is designed to ghost you.

But what if you could flip the script?

Karen was exactly where you are. Stuck. Silent inbox. Zero momentum.

Then she learned what I call the "Career Launch Method" — the exact system hiring managers use to evaluate candidates (I know because I was one).

90 days later, she had 4 offers on the table: Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone.

She picked Google.

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews or offers?

I need you to understand something important:

The job market is getting HARDER, not easier.

Every month that passes:
• More graduates flood the market
• AI tools eliminate entry-level positions
• Companies raise their requirements
• Your resume gap gets longer (and harder to explain)

That 6-month gap? Hiring managers notice. That 12-month gap? They really notice.

Time is not on your side.

Here's the math:
• Average engineering salary: $80,000/year
• That's $6,700/month
• Every month without a job costs you $6,700

6 months of "figuring it out" = $40,000 in lost income.

The free advice from YouTube? The resume templates from Reddit? They're not free. They're costing you thousands every month they don't work.

I help engineers get interview-ready in 21 days — not 6 months.

Sarah went from intern to $106K at Ford.
Karen went from stuck to choosing between Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone.

**Sarah's story:**
She was finishing an internship, terrified about what came next. No full-time offers. Watching her classmates post "I'm excited to announce..." while her inbox stayed empty.

After working with me: $106K offer at Ford. Accepted.

**Karen's story:**
She was stuck. Couldn't articulate her value. Kept getting ghosted after interviews. Starting to doubt if she was even cut out for engineering.

After working with me: 4 offers in 90 days. Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone. She picked Google.

Here's what they had in common:

They were smart. They worked hard. They did everything "right."

But nobody taught them how to actually get hired.

You start to wonder:

Let me stop you right there.

You are not the problem.

You graduated with an engineering degree. You did the hard work. You proved you can handle complex challenges.

The problem is simple: Nobody taught you how to get hired.

Your professors taught you thermodynamics and calculus. They didn't teach you how to write a resume that gets interviews. How to tell stories that land offers. How to negotiate your salary.

That's the missing piece.

I help engineers close that gap:
• From feeling "less than" to confident
• From comparing yourself to others to focusing on YOUR path
• From "no callbacks" to "which offer should I accept?"

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

It's not about who's smarter or more qualified.

It's about who knows how to COMMUNICATE their value.

Your friends who are landing jobs? They're not necessarily better engineers. They're better at showing companies why they should be hired.

That's a skill. And you can learn it.

The right system can close the gap faster than you think.

Karen was stuck while her peers were getting offers. Felt like she'd never catch up.

90 days later?

While her friends were starting entry-level jobs, Karen was choosing between:

She didn't just catch up. She leapfrogged.

Sarah was an intern watching full-time offers go to everyone else.

Now she makes $106K at Ford — more than most of her classmates who got hired before her.

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

Let me tell you the difference between you and them:

It's not intelligence. You both passed the same classes.
It's not work ethic. You both grinded through the same projects.
It's not luck. (Well, maybe a little.)

The real difference?

They learned how to communicate their value. You didn't.

That's it. That's the whole secret.

Here's what I mean:

When a hiring manager asks "Tell me about yourself," your friend has a compelling 90-second story that positions them as the obvious choice.

You have... a rambling summary of your resume.

When they ask "Why should we hire you?" your friend connects their experience to the company's specific needs.

You give generic answers about being a "hard worker" and "team player."

Same skills. Different packaging. Wildly different results.

The good news? This is 100% learnable.

I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I've seen what separates the candidates who get offers from the ones who get ghosted.

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

You're working just as hard as they are. Maybe harder.

You've sent hundreds of applications. Spent hours tweaking your resume. Practiced interview questions until you can recite them in your sleep.

And still... nothing.

Meanwhile, your friend who graduated with a lower GPA just posted about their new job at a company you applied to.

What gives?

Here's the frustrating truth:

Hard work without the right strategy is just... wasted effort.

You can send 500 more applications using the same resume. You'll get the same results.

You can practice 100 more interview questions. If you're practicing the wrong way, it won't help.

There's a faster path.

I've hired engineers. I know what makes us say yes.

The 21-Day Blueprint is that shortcut:
• 3 sessions, not 6 months of guessing
• Proven system, not random YouTube advice
• Real feedback, not wondering what went wrong

Karen took the shortcut → 4 offers in 90 days
Sarah took the shortcut → $106K at Ford

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

I know what you're feeling.

Maybe people are starting to talk. Family members asking awkward questions. Friends giving you that sympathetic look.

Maybe you're starting to doubt yourself too.

"Maybe I'm just not cut out for this."
"Maybe I should have picked a different major."
"Maybe I'm not as good as I thought I was."

Stop.

You graduated with an engineering degree. That puts you in the top tier of problem-solvers in the world.

The issue isn't your ability. It's that nobody taught you the ONE skill that actually matters after graduation: how to get hired.

You know what's better than proving the doubters wrong?

Proving them SO wrong they look foolish for ever doubting you.

Karen felt the doubt too. Then she got offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone. In 90 days.

Imagine the look on everyone's face when you announce you got hired at Google.

That aunt who kept asking "So... still looking?" Quiet.
That friend who got hired before you? Suddenly asking YOU for advice.

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

Let me guess your strategy:

Find job posting → Slightly tweak resume → Hit submit → Repeat 50 times → Refresh inbox → Nothing → Repeat.

Sound familiar?

Here's the problem:

You're playing a numbers game you can't win.

The average engineering job posting gets 250+ applications. Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on each resume. Your carefully crafted application? It probably never got read by a human.

More applications ≠ more interviews.

Better applications = more interviews.

There's a difference between:
• A resume that gets filtered out by ATS software
• A resume that makes recruiters stop scrolling

I help engineers make that shift.

I'm a former hiring manager. I know what makes us pull a resume out of the pile. What makes us actually read it. What makes us schedule an interview.

Karen was stuck in the volume trap. Sending applications, hearing nothing.

After learning the system: 4 offers in 90 days. Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone.

At 6 months, it raises questions.
At 12 months, it's a red flag you have to explain away.

The longer you're stuck, the harder it gets to get unstuck.

And it's not just the resume gap.

It's the $6,700/month you're not earning.
It's the student loans piling up interest.

After 50+ applications, you've probably asked yourself:

"What am I doing wrong?"

Let me tell you what it probably is:

**Problem #1: Your resume looks like everyone else's**
Same format. Same bullet points. Same generic language. Recruiters see hundreds of identical resumes. Yours doesn't stand out.

**Problem #2: You're not speaking their language**
Your resume talks about what YOU did. Hiring managers care about what you can do for THEM.

**Problem #3: Your stories are weak**
When you get an interview, you give rambling, unfocused answers. You haven't prepared the specific stories that make companies say "yes."

**Problem #4: You're applying wrong**
Spray and pray doesn't work. Targeted, strategic applications do.

These are all fixable.

And right now, it's sitting in a drawer. Unused.

Every day without a job, you're not getting the ROI you were promised.

"Get an engineering degree," they said. "Engineers always get jobs," they said.

Nobody told you the degree was just the ticket to the game — not a guarantee you'd win.

You feel cheated. And honestly? You should.

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

This is actually a GREAT sign.

Hear me out:

If you're getting interviews, your resume works. Companies see something in you worth exploring.

The problem isn't getting in the door. The problem is what happens once you're there.

Somewhere in the interview process, something goes wrong:
• Maybe you freeze up when they ask technical questions
• Maybe your answers ramble and lose focus
• Maybe you can't explain what makes you different
• Maybe you don't know how to close

The good news? Interviewing is a skill. And skills can be learned.

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

Let me share a secret from my years as a hiring manager:

There's a formula to interviews. Most candidates don't know it.

When we ask "Tell me about yourself," we're not looking for your life story. We're looking for a specific structure that signals "this person gets it."

When we ask "What's your greatest weakness," there's a right way and a wrong way to answer. Most people get it wrong.

When we ask behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time when..."), we're listening for a specific pattern. Hit it, you move forward. Miss it, you're out.

The candidates who get offers aren't necessarily the most qualified.

They're the ones who know the formula.

Karen was qualified. She just didn't know the formula.

After learning it: Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone all made offers in 90 days.

Same person. Same qualifications. Different interview performance.

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

You've probably "practiced" for interviews.

Looked up common questions. Thought about your answers. Maybe rehearsed in front of a mirror.

Here's the thing:

That's not real practice. That's preparation theater.

Real practice looks like this:
• Someone asks you questions you don't expect
• You answer under pressure, with stakes
• You get honest feedback on what worked and what didn't
• You adjust and try again

Without real practice, you're walking into interviews hoping you perform well.

With real practice, you KNOW you'll perform well.

The 21-Day Blueprint includes mock interviews that feel like the real thing:
• Questions based on what companies actually ask
• Real-time pressure that simulates the actual experience
• Honest feedback (not "you did great, sweetie" from your mom)
• Iteration until your answers are bulletproof

Getting engineering interviews, but not offers?

Can I be honest about something?

Interviewers can smell desperation.

When you're nervous, it shows.
When you're unsure of yourself, it shows.
When you're worried about whether you're good enough, it shows.

And it costs you offers.

I'm not saying this to make you feel bad. I'm saying it because it's fixable.

Confidence in interviews comes from:
• Knowing exactly what you're going to say
• Having practiced until it feels natural
• Understanding what the interviewer actually wants
• Believing you deserve the job (because you do)

Most engineers are humble. You're trained to say "I don't know" when you don't know.

In interviews, that humility becomes a liability.

The 21-Day Blueprint helps you:
• Build genuine confidence through preparation
• Develop answers you can deliver without hesitation
• Learn how to project competence (even when you're nervous)
• Walk in knowing you're the right person for the job

• Whether you have 2 good stories or 5 great ones
• If you ask smart questions at the end
• How you follow up afterward

These aren't massive changes. They're tweaks.

But they're the tweaks that separate "We'll be in touch" from "We want to make you an offer."

You want to help, but you're not sure how. The job market has changed. Your advice doesn't seem to land.

Meanwhile, you're watching them lose confidence. Get more frustrated. Start to doubt themselves.

It's painful to watch.

That investment was supposed to pay off with a good job.

And right now, it's not paying off.

• That's student loan interest piling up

PARENTS:

Imagine Thanksgiving:

"How's the job search going?"

"They just got hired at Google."

Silence. Then:
"Google?! That's incredible!"

Karen's parents felt this.
You could too.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

Imagine this conversation at Thanksgiving:

"So how's [your child]'s job search going?"

Instead of the awkward pause and mumbled update...

"Actually, they just accepted an offer at Google."

Silence. Then:
"Google?! That's incredible!"
"We always knew they'd do something great!"
"You must be so proud!"

Yes. Yes you are.

That's what happened for Karen's parents. She was stuck. Frustrated. Doubting herself.

Then she worked with me on the 21-Day Blueprint.

90 days later, she was choosing between Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone.

She picked Google.

Her parents went from worried to bursting with pride.

I'm Mansour, a former engineering hiring manager. I know what companies look for because I've been on that side of the table.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

They probably haven't told you how bad it really is.

The constant rejection. The silence. The automated emails at 3am. The creeping self-doubt.

They don't want you to worry. They don't want to feel like a burden.

So they say "I'm working on it" and change the subject.

But you can see it in their eyes. The stress. The frustration. The fear that maybe they're not cut out for this.

As a parent, you want to help. But what can you do?

The job market has changed. LinkedIn barely existed when you were job searching. AI is reshaping everything. Your well-meaning advice ("Just call them!") doesn't quite land.

Here's what you CAN do:

Point them toward someone who knows the current landscape. Someone who's been on the hiring side. Someone who can teach them what they didn't learn in school.

I'm Mansour. I was an engineering hiring manager. Now I help new engineers land jobs through a 21-Day Blueprint.

Karen was stuck. Now she works at Google.
Sarah was an intern. Now she makes $106K at Ford.

🔒 **Only 10 spots per month** — personalized 1:1 coaching.

PARENTS:

Every month they're stuck:

• $6,700 not earned
• Confidence eroding
• Resume gap growing
• Student loans piling up

Program cost: $1,000 (50% off)
One month lost income: $6,700

Every month you wait
costs more than the solution.

Only 10 spots/month
```

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

Every month they're stuck costs them about $6,700.

(Average engineering starting salary is ~$80,000/year. Divide by 12.)

It also costs them:
• Confidence
• Momentum
• Resume gap that gets harder to explain
• Interest accumulating on student loans

And it costs you:
• Worry
• Awkward conversations
• Possibly supporting them longer than planned

Time is the enemy here.

The longer this goes on, the harder it gets. The gap grows. The doubt sets in. The market gets more competitive.

I help engineers fix this in 21 days.

Not 6 more months of trial and error.
Not endless YouTube videos with contradictory advice.
Not more applications into the void.

3 focused sessions. A proven system. Real results.

Karen: Stuck → Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone (4 offers in 90 days)
Sarah: Intern → $106K at Ford

🔒 **Only 10 spots per month** — I limit enrollment for quality.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You watched them grow up. Cheered at graduations. Bragged to friends about their big engineering degree.

And now they're stuck.

They're smart. They worked hard. They did everything right.

But the job market isn't what it used to be.

When you were their age, a degree meant something. Companies recruited on campus. A firm handshake and eye contact went a long way.

Today? They're competing against thousands online. AI is changing everything. The rules are different.

Your advice ("Pound the pavement! Call the manager!") comes from a good place, but it doesn't quite fit anymore.

Here's how you CAN help:

Point them toward someone who understands this new world.

I'm Mansour. I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I help new engineers land jobs through a 21-Day Blueprint.

Results:
• Karen was stuck → 4 offers in 90 days (Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone)
• Sarah was struggling → $106K at Ford

Here's a gift that could change their life:

The 21-Day Engineering Career Blueprint.

It's not a thing. It's a transformation.

3 sessions, 90 minutes each. Personalized coaching, not a generic course.

The result:

• Sarah went from intern to $106K at Ford

🔒 **Only 10 spots per month** — I keep it limited for personalized attention.

💰 **50% off:** $1,000 (normally $2,000). Probably less than you spent on their graduation gift. But worth infinitely more.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You've been there for every milestone.

First day of school. Graduations. The proud moment they said "I'm going to be an engineer."

But this milestone — landing their first real job — is stuck.

And watching them struggle is hard.

They're sending applications. Getting rejected. Starting to doubt themselves.

You want to help, but you're not sure how. Times have changed.

Here's what I want you to know:

They're not failing. The system failed them.

Universities taught them calculus and thermodynamics. Nobody taught them how to get hired.

I fix that gap.

I'm Mansour, a former engineering hiring manager. My 21-Day Blueprint teaches new engineers exactly what companies are looking for.

The results speak:
• Karen: Stuck → 4 offers in 90 days, including Google

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above image):**

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

When you were starting out, things were different.

You could walk into a company. Ask for the manager. Hand them your resume. Get hired on the spot.

A firm handshake meant something. Loyalty was valued. A degree opened doors.

Today?

Your grandkid is competing against 500 other applicants for every job. A computer screens their resume before a human ever sees it. "Networking" happens on LinkedIn, not at Rotary Club.

The advice that worked for you doesn't quite work anymore.

But that doesn't mean you can't help.

You might not understand the new game. But you can connect them with someone who does.

I'm Mansour. I'm a former engineering hiring manager. I know exactly how companies hire today — because I've been on that side.

My 21-Day Blueprint teaches new engineers:
• How to beat the computer screening (it's called "ATS")
• How to stand out on LinkedIn
• How to interview in a way that lands offers

Karen was stuck. Now she works at Google.
Sarah was lost. Now she makes $106K at Ford.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

Picture the next family holiday:

Someone asks: "So how's [your grandchild] doing?"

And instead of the awkward pause...

You say: "They just got hired at Google. We couldn't be more proud."

The room goes quiet. Then everyone wants to hear the story.

"Google?! How did they manage that?"

You smile. "They worked with an incredible career coach. Turned everything around in 90 days."

That's exactly what happened for Karen's family. She was stuck. Frustrated. Sending applications into the void.

Then she learned the system that hiring managers actually look for.

90 days later: Offers from Google, SpaceX, GE, and Bridgestone.

She picked Google.

I'm Mansour, the coach who helped her get there. And I want to help your grandkid have the same success story.

## Quick Reference: Urgency & Scarcity Elements

### On Graphics:
- `50% OFF — $1,000 (normally $2,000)`
- `Only 10 spots/month`

### In Primary Text:
- 🔒 **Capacity:** "I only accept 10 clients per month. Every session is 1:1 and deeply personalized — quality requires limits."
- 💰 **Pricing:** "Currently 50% off: $1,000 (normally $2,000) — less than one month of the salary you're missing out on."
- ✅ **Guarantee:** "The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™: Transformed resume, 15+ STAR stories, mock interview, and confidence — or I keep coaching you free until we do."

### Why It's Real (Not Fake Scarcity):
- 3 sessions × 90 minutes = 4.5 hours per client
- Plus prep, follow-up, and support time
- 10 clients = ~50+ hours/month of dedicated coaching
- This is personalized 1:1 work, not a scalable course
