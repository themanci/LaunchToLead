Engineering grad? Job hunt feeling impossible after 50+ rejections?

Every month without a job costs you $6,700.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you the exact resume framework engineers have used to land jobs at Google, SpaceX, GE, Ford, and Bridgestone. Grab it below.

But first, let's do the real math:
• 3 months of trial and error = $20,000 gone
• 6 months = $40,000 gone
• 1 year = $80,000 gone

The "free" advice from YouTube, Reddit, and career centers? It's the most expensive advice you'll ever take.

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't your degree, your GPA, or your experience. It's your resume.

Most engineering resumes look exactly the same — generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving on.

Karen used the Impact Bullet Builder. She went from zero callbacks to 4 offers in 90 days — including Google.

Sarah used it too. She went from anxious intern to $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours for free.

Struggling engineer? No callbacks, interviews, or offers?

The job market is getting harder every month.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem — your resume. Grab it below.

Here's what's working against you right now:
• More graduates flooding the market every semester
• AI tools replacing entry-level engineering positions
• Companies raising their requirements
• Your resume gap getting longer (and harder to explain)

That 6-month gap? Hiring managers notice. That 12-month gap? They really notice.

And the math doesn't lie:
• Average engineering salary: $80,000/year
• That's $6,700/month
• 6 months of "figuring it out" = $40,000 in lost income

The free advice from YouTube and Reddit resume templates? They're not free. They cost you thousands every month they don't work.

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't your degree, your GPA, or the market. It's your resume. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving on.

Karen used the Impact Bullet Builder. She went from zero callbacks to 4 offers — including Google.

Friends snagging engineering jobs while you're passed over?

Same grades. Same projects. Same internships. So why are they getting offers while you're getting ghosted?

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you exactly what they're doing differently. Grab it below.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

It's not about who's smarter or more qualified. It's about who knows how to communicate their value on a resume.

Your friends landing jobs aren't better engineers. They're better at showing companies why they should be hired. That's a skill — and you can learn it.

Most engineering resumes look exactly the same. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving on.

Karen had the same problem. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. She went from zero callbacks to 4 offers — including Google.

Sarah used it too. She went from anxious intern to $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours for free.

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

I'm going to validate something you might be feeling: this is exhausting.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real reason you keep getting rejected. Grab it below.

The endless applications. The hope every time you hit "submit." The crushing disappointment of another rejection (or worse, silence). The cycle repeating over and over.

It's not supposed to be this hard.

You spent 4 years getting an engineering degree. You worked your ass off. You did everything right. And now you're spending hours every day on applications that go nowhere.

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't the job market. It's your resume. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving to the next one.

Karen was exhausted too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google.

Sarah was frustrated too. Then: $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours for free.

You've suffered enough. Let's end this.

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You're watching them struggle and it's hard. They did everything right — got the grades, finished the degree, did internships, worked hard.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem. Share it with them or grab it below.

Here's what's happening: universities teach engineering, not job searching. Career centers hand them a resume template and say "good luck." That's it.

The gap between "educated" and "employed" isn't their fault. Nobody taught them how to communicate their value on a resume. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds before moving on.

Meanwhile, you're watching them lose confidence. Get more frustrated. Start to doubt themselves.

Karen's parents watched her struggle too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers in 90 days — including Google.

Sarah's parents saw the same thing. Then: $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's free.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You watched them grow up. Cheered at graduations. Bragged to friends about their big engineering degree. And now they're stuck.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem. Share it with them or grab it below.

They're smart. They worked hard. They did everything right. But the job market isn't what it used to be.

When you were their age, a degree meant something. Companies recruited on campus. A firm handshake went a long way. Today? They're competing against thousands online. AI is changing everything.

Your advice comes from a good place, but the rules are different now. Here's how you CAN help: point them toward a free guide that fixes the real problem — their resume.

Nobody taught them how to communicate their value. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds before moving on.

Karen's grandparents watched her struggle too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder. Then: 4 offers in 90 days — including Google.

Sarah was struggling too. Then: $106K at Ford.

50+ engineering apps, zero offers?

That engineering degree cost you 4+ years and up to $200K. And right now, it's sitting in a drawer.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem. Grab it below.

"Get an engineering degree," they said. "Engineers always get jobs," they said.

Nobody told you the degree was just the ticket to the game — not a guarantee you'd win.

You feel cheated. And honestly? You should. Your university taught you thermodynamics but not how to get hired. Career services gave you a template and said "good luck."

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't your degree. It's your resume. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving on.

Karen’s degree was gathering dust. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google.

Sarah was an underpaid intern. Then: $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours for free.

Your degree is worth something. Time to prove it.
