## Karen's Video Transcript
> "The big surprise is how much confidence I gained — from feeling insecure into being very well prepared and clear about my value when I step into an interview. So after implementing these changes, everything really shifted. I started getting more interviews and better conversations with hiring managers. I even landed interviews with major companies such as Bridgestone, Google, and SpaceX — companies that I never imagined I would have a shot with. Ultimately, I accepted a role that was a very big step forward. More responsibility, more growth, and most importantly, something that really challenges me and excites me."

## Version 1 — Rejection + Proof
**Callout:** "50+ engineering apps and nothing but silence?"

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above video):**

50+ engineering apps and nothing but silence?

No callbacks. No interviews. Just rejection after rejection.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you the exact resume formula engineers have used to land interviews at Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone. Grab it below.

Karen was in the exact same spot. Engineering degree. Solid experience. But her resume wasn't communicating her value — so nobody was responding.

She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. One framework. One formula. That's it.

What happened next:
• Went from zero callbacks to back-to-back interviews
• Landed interviews at Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone
• Accepted a role with more responsibility, more growth, and more money

She didn't get a second degree. She didn't go back to school. She didn't "network harder."

She fixed her resume. That's what changed everything.

The same formula Karen used — the Impact Bullet Builder — is yours for free. It shows you exactly how to turn generic bullet points into ones that make hiring managers stop scrolling and pick up the phone.

## Version 2 — Confidence + Identity
**Callout:** "Engineering grad who feels like a fraud in interviews?"

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above video):**

Engineering grad who feels like a fraud in interviews?

You know you're qualified. But the second you sit down across from a hiring manager, your mind goes blank. You stumble. You undersell yourself.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes this. It's the same resume formula Karen used before she landed interviews at Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone. Grab it below.

She went from "feeling insecure" to walking into interviews "very well prepared and clear about my value." Her words, not mine.

The shift? She used a free framework called the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite every bullet on her resume. It forced her to quantify her impact, structure her experience, and actually see her own value on paper.

Once she could see it, she could say it. Confidence wasn't some mindset trick — it was a side effect of having a resume that actually reflected what she'd done.

The results:
• Interviews at Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone
• Better conversations with hiring managers (because she finally knew what to say)
• Accepted a role with more responsibility, more growth, and real challenge

The Impact Bullet Builder is free. It's the same formula Karen used. And it might be the thing that finally makes you feel like you belong in the room — because you do.

## Version 3 — Financial Cost + Urgency
**Callout:** "Struggling engineer? Every month without a job costs you $6,700."

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT (above video):**

Struggling engineer? Every month without a job costs you $6,700.

3 months = $20,000 gone. 6 months = $40,000 gone. And your resume gap keeps growing.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem — your resume. Grab it below.

Karen was losing money every month too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume bullets — and everything shifted.

"I started getting more interviews and better conversations with hiring managers. I even landed interviews with Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone — companies I never imagined I'd have a shot with."

That's Karen. Real person. Real results. Same formula you can download right now for free.

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't the job market, your degree, or your experience. It's your resume. Generic bullet points that look like every other applicant's. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving on.

The Impact Bullet Builder shows you exactly how to fix that. It's the same formula Karen used to go from zero callbacks to offers from companies you've only dreamed about.

Every month you wait is another $6,700 you don't get back.
