# AD 01 — Financial Bleed
**Source:** Meta Ad 02 | **Graphic:** linkedin-ad-01.html
**Angle:** Every month without a job costs $6,700. Resume is the bottleneck.

---

### Introductory Text
_Recommended version — paste directly into Campaign Manager:_

I've been on the hiring side at engineering companies. Here's something most candidates don't realize:

Every month you can't land a job, you lose ~$6,700 in salary. I created a free 14-page guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the root cause. It takes 30 minutes to apply.

The resume is always the bottleneck. Not the degree, not the GPA, not the market.

When I reviewed engineering resumes, 95% looked identical. "Collaborated with cross-functional teams." "Utilized MATLAB for analysis." "Assisted with testing procedures."

Those lines communicate nothing. They describe a job posting, not a result. Hiring managers see them 200 times a day.

The engineers who stand out write bullets with specific, measurable outcomes. That's a learnable skill — and that's exactly what this guide teaches.

Karen applied the formula: 4 offers including Google & SpaceX.
Sarah applied it: $106K at Ford.

14 pages. Free. No email drip — just the guide.

#### Alternative Introductory Text — Version A (Direct Hook)

Engineering grad with 50+ rejections?

That's not bad luck. That's a $6,700/month problem. I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real issue — your resume. Grab it below.

Here's the math nobody talks about:

→ 1 month without a job = $6,700 lost
→ 3 months = $20,100
→ 6 months = $40,200
→ 12 months = $80,400

That number only grows. And while it grows, your confidence shrinks, your gap gets harder to explain, and recruiters start asking why you've been unemployed so long.

The problem isn't the job market. It's not your GPA. It's 14 bullet points on your resume that say nothing.

Generic lines like "Assisted with testing" and "Collaborated with cross-functional teams" blend in with the other 200 resumes the recruiter saw today. You get 6 seconds of attention — and those bullets waste every one of them.

Karen had the same problem. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers in 90 days — including Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah used it too. She went from anxious intern to $106K at Ford.

Same formula. Same framework. It's yours free.

# AD 02 — Urgency / Market Getting Harder
**Source:** Meta Ad 07 | **Graphic:** linkedin-ad-02.html
**Angle:** Market is the hardest it's been. Your classmates are pulling ahead. Clock is ticking.

---

### Introductory Text
_Recommended version — paste directly into Campaign Manager:_

75% of engineering resumes get auto-rejected by ATS before a human ever reads them.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gets your resume past both the algorithm and the 6-second recruiter scan. Here's why this matters right now:

The engineering job market in 2026 is fundamentally different from 2020. Companies are hiring slower, demanding more, and screening harder. New grads are competing against candidates with 2-3 years of experience who got laid off.

Your university didn't prepare you for this. Career services gave you a resume template from 2015 and said "apply everywhere."

That template is the problem.

When every bullet says "Assisted with..." and "Collaborated on..." — you look identical to the other 500 applicants. Recruiters close your resume in 6 seconds.

The Impact Bullet Builder rewrites every bullet using a specific formula: what you did + the measurable result + how you did it + why it mattered.

Engineers have used it to land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

Free. 14 pages. No strings.

#### Alternative Introductory Text — Version A (Direct Hook)

Struggling engineer? No callbacks?

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real reason you're getting passed over. Grab it below — it takes 30 minutes to apply.

Here's what's happening right now:

→ The job market for new engineers is the hardest it's been in years
→ AI is changing hiring — ATS systems auto-reject 75% of resumes before a human sees them
→ Your classmates are getting ahead while you're still refreshing your inbox

Every month you wait, the gap between "new grad" and "unemployed gap" gets wider. Hiring managers start asking questions you don't want to answer.

The problem isn't effort. You're applying everywhere. The problem is what you're sending out.

Generic resume bullets like "Supported the engineering team" tell a recruiter nothing. You get 6 seconds — and those words waste every one.

Karen was in the same spot. Zero callbacks. She used the Impact Bullet Builder and landed 4 offers in 90 days — including Google.

Sarah was frustrated too. Then: $106K at Ford.

The window is closing. Fix the resume first.

# AD 03 — Friends Getting Hired
**Source:** Meta Ad 11 | **Graphic:** linkedin-ad-03.html
**Angle:** Same degree, same classes — why are they getting hired and you're not?

---

### Introductory Text
_Recommended version — paste directly into Campaign Manager:_

Two resumes. Same engineering internship. Same project. Here's what they look like:

BEFORE: "Assisted with firmware development and testing procedures"
AFTER: "Cut field failure rate by 62% by refactoring the CAN bus interrupt handler in C to implement priority-based arbitration across 8 ECUs"

The difference? A formula I packaged into a free 14-page guide called the Impact Bullet Builder. It rewrites every bullet on your resume in about 30 minutes.

Same work. Same experience. Different communication. One gets calls. The other gets silence.

Your classmates who are getting hired aren't smarter. They're not more connected. They just know how to translate their work into measurable outcomes on paper.

Karen used this formula. 4 offers — Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.
Sarah used it. $106K at Ford.

Works on internships, class projects, research, and part-time work.

#### Alternative Introductory Text — Version A (Direct Hook)

Friends getting engineering jobs while you're getting ghosted?

Same grades. Same projects. Same internships. I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you exactly what they're doing differently. Grab it below.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

It's not about who's smarter or more qualified. It's about who knows how to communicate their value on a resume.

Your friends landing jobs aren't better engineers. They're better at showing companies why they should be hired. That's a skill — and you can learn it.

Most engineering resumes look exactly the same. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving on.

They write: "Reduced defect rate by 23% by implementing automated test protocols."
You write: "Assisted with quality assurance testing."

Same work. One gets calls. One gets ghosted.

Karen had the same problem. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google.

Sarah used it too. $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours free.

# AD 04 — Exhausting Cycle
**Source:** Meta Ad 19 | **Graphic:** linkedin-ad-04.html
**Angle:** 50+ apps, zero offers. The cycle is exhausting. Your resume is the problem.

### Introductory Text
_Recommended version — paste directly into Campaign Manager:_

50+ engineering applications. Zero offers.

This is exhausting. I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real reason you keep getting rejected. Grab it below.

The endless applications. The hope every time you hit "submit." The crushing disappointment of another rejection — or worse, silence. The cycle repeating over and over.

It's not supposed to be this hard.

You spent 4 years getting an engineering degree. You worked incredibly hard. You did everything right. And now you're spending hours every day on applications that go nowhere.

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't the job market. It's your resume.

Generic bullet points that say nothing. "Assisted with testing." "Collaborated with cross-functional teams." "Utilized MATLAB for analysis." Those lines appear on every engineering resume. They tell a recruiter nothing about YOU.

Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on your resume before moving to the next one. And those bullets waste every second.

Karen was exhausted too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google.

Sarah was frustrated too. Then: $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours for free.

You've earned this. Let's fix it.

#### Alternative Introductory Text — Version B (Empathy Hook)

I know what it feels like to apply to 50+ engineering jobs and hear nothing back.

That's why I built the Impact Bullet Builder — a free 14-page guide that fixes the exact thing that's causing the silence. It takes 30 minutes.

The cycle is brutal: find a job posting, tailor the cover letter (again), submit, wait, get rejected or ghosted, start over. Every round chips away at your confidence a little more.

But here's the part most people don't see: the problem was never your qualifications. It was 14 bullet points on your resume that said "Assisted with..." instead of showing measurable impact.

Hiring managers spend 6 seconds scanning. If nothing stops them — they move on. It's not personal. It's a volume game, and your resume is losing it.

The Impact Bullet Builder rewrites every bullet using a formula: accomplishment + metric + method + business impact.

Karen applied it. 4 offers including Google.
Sarah applied it. $106K at Ford.

Free. No email drip. Just the guide.

# AD 05 — Wasted Degree
**Source:** Meta Ad 20 | **Graphic:** linkedin-ad-05.html
**Angle:** Your $200K engineering degree is sitting in a drawer. Resume is the bottleneck.

---

### Introductory Text
_Recommended version — paste directly into Campaign Manager:_

Let's do the math on your engineering degree:

→ 4+ years of your life
→ $50K – $200K in tuition
→ Thousands of hours studying, building, testing
→ Current ROI: $0/month

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that turns that investment into job offers. 14 pages. 30 minutes to apply.

The degree wasn't supposed to end here. You were supposed to graduate and have companies lining up. Instead, you're competing against 500 people for every opening and hearing nothing back.

The problem? Your resume communicates duties instead of outcomes. "Collaborated with cross-functional teams" appears on every engineering resume in the country. It tells the recruiter absolutely nothing.

The Impact Bullet Builder teaches a formula that rewrites every bullet into a specific, measurable accomplishment. It works on internships, class projects, research, and part-time work.

Karen applied it. 4 offers — Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.
Sarah applied it. $106K at Ford.

Your degree is worth something. Your resume just doesn't show it yet.

#### Alternative Introductory Text — Version A (Direct Hook)

Your engineering degree cost you 4+ years and up to $200K. And right now, it's sitting in a drawer.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem. Grab it below — it takes 30 minutes.

"Get an engineering degree," they said. "Engineers always get jobs," they said.

Nobody told you the degree was just the ticket to the game — not a guarantee you'd win.

You feel cheated. And honestly? You should. Your university taught you thermodynamics and signal processing but not how to get hired. Career services gave you a resume template and said "good luck."

That template is the problem.

Generic bullet points like "Utilized SolidWorks for design modifications" tell a recruiter nothing. You blend in with the other 500 applicants. 6 seconds of attention — wasted.

Karen's degree was going unused. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah was an underpaid intern. Then: $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours for free.

Your degree is worth something. Time to prove it.

### Introductory Text

Is your kid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You're watching them struggle and it's hard. They did everything right — got the grades, finished the degree, did internships, worked hard.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem. Share it with them or grab it below.

Here's what's happening: universities teach engineering, not job searching. Career centers hand them a resume template and say "good luck." That's it.

The gap between "educated" and "employed" isn't their fault. Nobody taught them how to communicate their value on a resume. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds before moving on.

Meanwhile, you're watching them lose confidence. Get more frustrated. Start to doubt themselves.

Karen's parents watched her struggle too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers in 90 days — including Google.

Sarah's parents saw the same thing. Then: $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's free.

Is your grandkid an engineering grad with no job offers?

You watched them grow up. Cheered at graduations. Bragged to friends about their big engineering degree. And now they're stuck.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem. Share it with them or grab it below.

They're smart. They worked hard. They did everything right. But the job market isn't what it used to be.

When you were their age, a degree meant something. Companies recruited on campus. A firm handshake went a long way. Today? They're competing against thousands online. AI is changing everything.

Your advice comes from a good place, but the rules are different now. Here's how you CAN help: point them toward a free guide that fixes the real problem — their resume.

Nobody taught them how to communicate their value. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds before moving on.

Karen's grandparents watched her struggle too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder. Then: 4 offers in 90 days — including Google.

Sarah was struggling too. Then: $106K at Ford.
