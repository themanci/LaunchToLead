# AD 01 — Financial Bleed
**Based on:** Callout 1, Variation A
**Graphic:** linkedin-ad-01.html
**Angle:** Every month without a job costs $6,700 — your resume is the bottleneck

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

Engineering grad? 50+ applications and nothing?

Every month without a job costs you $6,700. Three months = $20,000 gone. And your resume gap keeps growing.

The problem isn't the market. It's that your resume reads like every other engineer's.

"Assisted with project deliverables." Hiring managers have seen that line 10,000 times. They skip you in 6 seconds.

I built a free 14-page guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes this. It's the exact formula my clients have used to land roles at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

Karen went from zero callbacks to 4 offers. Sarah went from anxious intern to $106K at Ford. Same formula. 30 minutes to apply.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version B (Comment CTA):**

Engineering grad? 50+ applications and nothing?

Every month without a job costs you $6,700. Three months = $20,000 gone.

The problem isn't your qualifications. It's 14 bullet points on a piece of paper that don't communicate your value.

Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on your resume. If every bullet says "Assisted with..." or "Utilized MATLAB for..." — you're invisible.

I packaged the exact resume formula that's helped engineers land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, and Bridgestone into a free 14-page guide.

It takes 30 minutes. No fluff.

Comment "GUIDE" and I'll send it to you.

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version C (Authority-Led Hook):**

I've reviewed thousands of engineering resumes from the hiring side.

95% of them say the exact same thing. "Assisted with project deliverables." "Utilized CAD software." "Collaborated with cross-functional teams." I skip those in 6 seconds. So does every other hiring manager.

Every month you're stuck costs ~$6,700 in lost income. And your resume is the bottleneck.

I built a free 14-page guide called the Impact Bullet Builder — the formula engineers have used to land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

30 minutes to apply. Completely free.

# AD 02 — Invisible Resume
**Based on:** Callout 2, Variation A
**Graphic:** linkedin-ad-02.html
**Angle:** Your resume isn't bad — it's invisible. You sound like everyone else.

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

Your resume isn't getting rejected. It's getting skipped.

Recruiters spend 6 seconds on it. They see "Assisted with project deliverables" — the same line they've read on 200 resumes today — and move on. You never hear back.

Your resume isn't bad. It's invisible. It sounds like everyone else's.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a free 14-page guide that fixes every bullet on your resume. It's a formula: what you accomplished + the metric + how you did it + why it mattered.

Engineers have used it to land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

30 minutes. Free. No email sequence — just the guide.

👉 Grab it: launchtolead.io/free

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version B (Comment CTA):**

I've been on the hiring side. Here's what actually happens to your resume:

A recruiter opens it. Scans the bullets. Sees "Collaborated with cross-functional teams" and "Utilized MATLAB for analysis" — the same words on every resume that week. Closes yours. Opens the next.

You didn't get rejected. You were never noticed.

I built a formula that fixes this. It rewrites every bullet so it communicates specific, measurable impact instead of generic duties.

Engineers have used it to go from zero callbacks to offers at Google, SpaceX, Ford, and Bridgestone.

Free. 14 pages. 30 minutes to apply.

Comment "GUIDE" and I'll send it to you.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version C (Data-Led Hook):**

75% of engineering resumes are auto-rejected by ATS software before a human ever sees them.

Of the 25% that get through, recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds on each one.

If your bullets say "Responsible for testing" or "Assisted with design" — you're invisible in both rounds.

I packaged the exact formula that's helped engineers land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone into a free guide:

The Impact Bullet Builder — 14 pages, 4-part formula, real before/after examples.

# AD 03 — The One Difference
**Based on:** Callout 3, Variation A
**Graphic:** linkedin-ad-03.html
**Angle:** Same degree, same classes — so why are your classmates getting hired and you're not?

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

Same classes. Same professors. Same all-nighters. So why are they getting hired while you're refreshing your inbox?

It's not connections. It's not luck. It's their resume.

They write: "Reduced defect rate by 23% by implementing automated test protocols."
You write: "Assisted with quality assurance testing."

Same work. One gets calls. One gets ghosted.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a free 14-page guide that teaches you the formula in 30 minutes. Engineers have used it to land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

You're not less qualified. You're less visible. This fixes that.

👉 Grab it free: launchtolead.io/free

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version B (Comment CTA):**

Your classmates aren't better engineers than you. They're better at communicating their value on paper.

That's the entire difference.

Their bullets have numbers. Yours have duties. Their resume tells a story. Yours reads like a job description.

This is a learnable skill. And I packaged it into a free 14-page guide.

The Impact Bullet Builder — the same formula engineers have used to land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, and Bridgestone.

30 minutes to apply. Works on internships, class projects, and part-time work.

Comment "GUIDE" and I'll send it to you.

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version C (Before/After Hook):**

Two engineers. Same internship. Same project. Here's what their resumes look like:

Engineer A: "Assisted with firmware development and testing procedures"

Engineer B: "Cut field failure rate by 62% by refactoring the CAN bus interrupt handler in C to implement priority-based arbitration across 8 ECUs"

Same work. Engineer B gets the interview. Every time.

The difference is a formula. And I'm giving it away free.

The Impact Bullet Builder — 14 pages, 30 minutes, real before/after examples from actual engineering resumes.

# AD 04 — The Real Bottleneck
**Based on:** Callout 4, Variation B
**Graphic:** linkedin-ad-04.html
**Angle:** The problem is 14 bullet points on a piece of paper that don't say anything.

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

50+ engineering applications. Zero offers.

The problem isn't the market, your GPA, or your experience. It's 14 bullet points on a piece of paper that don't say anything.

I've been on the hiring side. 95% of engineering resumes look identical:

• "Assisted the engineering team with project deliverables"
• "Collaborated with cross-functional teams"
• "Utilized MATLAB for analysis"

Those lines appear on every resume I've ever reviewed. They tell me nothing about YOU.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a free guide that rewrites those 14 bullets using a simple formula: what you accomplished + the result + how + why it mattered.

Karen applied it. Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone. Sarah applied it. $106K at Ford.

14 bullet points. 30 minutes. Free.

👉 Grab it: launchtolead.io/free

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version B (Comment CTA):**

I've hired engineers. I've reviewed thousands of resumes.

Here's what 95% of them say:

• "Responsible for data collection and reporting"
• "Collaborated with cross-functional teams"
• "Utilized SolidWorks for design modifications"

Every. Single. One.

These bullets tell me nothing. What did you actually accomplish? What improved because you were there?

The engineers who land at Google, Ford, SpaceX — they answer those questions in every bullet.

I packaged that formula into a free 14-page guide. It takes 30 minutes to apply.

Comment "GUIDE" and I'll send it to you.

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version C (Tactical/Numbers Hook):**

Your resume has roughly 14 bullet points. Each one gets about 6 seconds of attention.

That's 84 seconds to prove you're worth a phone call. And right now, most of those bullets say "Assisted with..." or "Responsible for..."

Those words communicate zero value. They describe a job posting, not a result.

The Impact Bullet Builder is a free formula that rewrites all 14 in about 30 minutes. Engineers have used it to land roles at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

# AD 05 — Closing Problem
**Based on:** Callout 5, Variation A
**Graphic:** linkedin-ad-05.html
**Angle:** Getting interviews but not offers — the problem starts on your resume.

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

Getting engineering interviews but not offers?

You're getting in the door. That means your resume works well enough to get noticed. But something falls apart between "tell me about yourself" and the offer.

Here's what's happening: your resume has vague bullets like "Assisted with testing." When the interviewer asks you to elaborate — you can't. Because that bullet gives you nothing to elaborate on.

The Impact Bullet Builder fixes both sides. It rewrites your resume AND gives you a built-in script for interviews. When every bullet is specific and quantified, you have 15+ ready-made answers for any behavioral question.

Karen used it. She described feeling "very well prepared and clear about my value." Result: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

Free. 14 pages. 30 minutes.

👉 Grab it: launchtolead.io/free

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version B (Comment CTA):**

If you're getting engineering interviews but not converting them to offers — the problem isn't your interview skills. It's your preparation.

Your resume says "Assisted with project deliverables." When they ask you to elaborate, what do you say? You ramble. You give a vague answer. They write "lacks depth." You don't get the offer.

The fix starts on paper. When your resume bullets are specific and quantified, they become your interview scripts. You know exactly what to say because you've already articulated it clearly.

I packaged this into a free 14-page guide — the Impact Bullet Builder.

Engineers have used it to convert interviews into offers at Google, SpaceX, Ford, and Bridgestone.

Comment "GUIDE" and I'll send it to you.

---

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version C (Insight Hook):**

Interviews and offers require two different skills. Most engineers only prepare for one.

Getting the interview = your resume's job. Converting it = your ability to articulate value under pressure.

But here's what nobody tells you: both skills come from the same place — clearly defined accomplishments.

When your resume bullets are vague, your interview answers are vague. When they're specific and quantified, you walk in with 15+ ready-made stories.

The Impact Bullet Builder teaches this system. Free. 14 pages. 30 minutes.
