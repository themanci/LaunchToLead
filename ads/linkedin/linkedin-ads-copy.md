# AD 01 — Financial Bleed
**Source:** Meta Ad 02 (Financial Loss / $6,700)

**Angle:** Every month without a job is costing you $6,700. Your resume is the bottleneck.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

Engineering grad with 50+ rejections?

That's not bad luck. That's a $6,700/month problem. I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real issue — your resume. Grab it below.

Here's the math nobody talks about:

→ 1 month without a job = $6,700 lost
→ 3 months = $20,100
→ 6 months = $40,200
→ 12 months = $80,400

That number only grows. And while it grows, your confidence shrinks, your gap gets harder to explain, and recruiters start asking why you've been unemployed so long.

The problem isn't the job market. It's not your GPA. It's 14 bullet points on your resume that say nothing.

Generic lines like "Assisted with testing" and "Collaborated with cross-functional teams" blend in with the other 200 resumes the recruiter saw today. You get 6 seconds of attention — and those bullets waste every one of them.

Karen had the same problem. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers in 90 days — including Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah used it too. She went from anxious intern to $106K at Ford.

Same formula. Same framework. It's yours free.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version B (Comment CTA):**

Engineering grad? 50+ applications and nothing?

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the #1 reason engineers get ghosted. The framework takes 30 minutes to apply to your entire resume.

Here's the uncomfortable math:

Every month without a job costs you ~$6,700 in lost salary. By month 6, you've lost $40K+. By month 12, $80K.

Your university taught you thermodynamics. Not job searching. Career services gave you a template and said "good luck." That template is why your resume sounds identical to every other engineering grad's.

Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on your resume. If they see "Assisted with project deliverables" — they close it. Not because you're not qualified. Because you look like everyone else.

Karen used this framework. Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone — 4 offers.

Sarah used it. $106K at Ford.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version C (Authority-Led):**

I've been on the hiring side at engineering companies. Here's something most candidates don't realize:

Every month you can't land a job, you lose ~$6,700 in salary. I created a free 14-page guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the root cause. It takes 30 minutes to apply.

The resume is always the bottleneck. Not the degree, not the GPA, not the market.

When I reviewed engineering resumes, 95% looked identical. "Collaborated with cross-functional teams." "Utilized MATLAB for analysis." "Assisted with testing procedures."

Those lines communicate nothing. They describe a job posting, not a result. Hiring managers see them 200 times a day.

The engineers who stand out write bullets with specific, measurable outcomes. That's a learnable skill — and that's exactly what this guide teaches.

Karen applied the formula: 4 offers including Google & SpaceX.
Sarah applied it: $106K at Ford.

14 pages. Free. No email drip — just the guide.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

Struggling engineer? No callbacks?

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real reason you're getting passed over. Grab it below — it takes 30 minutes to apply.

Here's what's happening right now:

→ The job market for new engineers is the hardest it's been in years
→ AI is changing hiring — ATS systems auto-reject 75% of resumes before a human sees them
→ Your classmates are getting ahead while you're still refreshing your inbox

Every month you wait, the gap between "new grad" and "unemployed gap" gets wider. Hiring managers start asking questions you don't want to answer.

The problem isn't effort. You're applying everywhere. The problem is what you're sending out.

Generic resume bullets like "Supported the engineering team" tell a recruiter nothing. You get 6 seconds — and those words waste every one.

Karen was in the same spot. Zero callbacks. She used the Impact Bullet Builder and landed 4 offers in 90 days — including Google.

Sarah was frustrated too. Then: $106K at Ford.

The window is closing. Fix the resume first.

Engineering grads — the market isn't going to get easier.

I created a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the #1 reason you're not hearing back. It rewrites every bullet on your resume in 30 minutes.

Here's the reality:

Companies are hiring fewer new grads. AI screening tools are rejecting resumes before a human ever touches them. The engineers who wait for things to "get better" end up with a 6-month gap and even fewer options.

Meanwhile, your classmates who figured out how to communicate their value on paper? They're getting offers.

The difference isn't intelligence. It's not connections. It's 14 bullet points on a resume that either say something — or say nothing.

Karen figured this out. Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.
Sarah figured it out. $106K at Ford.

Same formula. Free. 14 pages.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version C (Data-Led):**

75% of engineering resumes get auto-rejected by ATS before a human ever reads them.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that gets your resume past both the algorithm and the 6-second recruiter scan. Here's why this matters right now:

The engineering job market in 2026 is fundamentally different from 2020. Companies are hiring slower, demanding more, and screening harder. New grads are competing against candidates with 2-3 years of experience who got laid off.

Your university didn't prepare you for this. Career services gave you a resume template from 2015 and said "apply everywhere."

That template is the problem.

When every bullet says "Assisted with..." and "Collaborated on..." — you look identical to the other 500 applicants. Recruiters close your resume in 6 seconds.

The Impact Bullet Builder rewrites every bullet using a specific formula: what you did + the measurable result + how you did it + why it mattered.

Engineers have used it to land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

Free. 14 pages. No strings.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version A (Direct):**

Friends getting engineering jobs while you're getting ghosted?

Same grades. Same projects. Same internships. I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you exactly what they're doing differently. Grab it below.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

It's not about who's smarter or more qualified. It's about who knows how to communicate their value on a resume.

Your friends landing jobs aren't better engineers. They're better at showing companies why they should be hired. That's a skill — and you can learn it.

Most engineering resumes look exactly the same. Generic bullet points that say nothing. Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on yours before moving on.

They write: "Reduced defect rate by 23% by implementing automated test protocols."
You write: "Assisted with quality assurance testing."

Same work. One gets calls. One gets ghosted.

Karen had the same problem. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google.

Sarah used it too. $106K at Ford.

Same framework. Same formula. It's yours free.

**📝 PRIMARY TEXT — Version B (Comment CTA):**

Your classmates aren't better engineers than you. They're better at one thing: communicating value on paper.

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that teaches this skill in 30 minutes. It's the same framework that helped engineers land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, and Bridgestone.

That's the entire difference between "ghosted" and "4 offers."

Their bullets have numbers. Yours have duties. Their resume tells a story of impact. Yours reads like a job description.

Two engineers. Same internship. Same project:

Engineer A: "Assisted with firmware development and testing"
Engineer B: "Cut field failure rate by 62% by refactoring the CAN bus interrupt handler in C to implement priority-based arbitration across 8 ECUs"

Same work. Engineer B gets the interview. Every time.

You're not less qualified. You're less visible. This formula fixes that.

Two resumes. Same engineering internship. Same project. Here's what they look like:

❌ "Assisted with firmware development and testing procedures"
✅ "Cut field failure rate by 62% by refactoring the CAN bus interrupt handler in C to implement priority-based arbitration across 8 ECUs"

The difference? A formula I packaged into a free 14-page guide called the Impact Bullet Builder. It rewrites every bullet on your resume in about 30 minutes.

Same work. Same experience. Different communication. One gets calls. The other gets silence.

Your classmates who are getting hired aren't smarter. They're not more connected. They just know how to translate their work into measurable outcomes on paper.

Karen used this formula. 4 offers — Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.
Sarah used it. $106K at Ford.

50+ engineering applications. Zero offers.

This is exhausting. I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real reason you keep getting rejected. Grab it below.

The endless applications. The hope every time you hit "submit." The crushing disappointment of another rejection — or worse, silence. The cycle repeating over and over.

It's not supposed to be this hard.

You spent 4 years getting an engineering degree. You worked incredibly hard. You did everything right. And now you're spending hours every day on applications that go nowhere.

Here's what nobody told you: the problem isn't the job market. It's your resume.

Generic bullet points that say nothing. "Assisted with testing." "Collaborated with cross-functional teams." "Utilized MATLAB for analysis." Those lines appear on every engineering resume. They tell a recruiter nothing about YOU.

Hiring managers spend 6 seconds on your resume before moving to the next one. And those bullets waste every second.

Karen was exhausted too. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google.

Engineers — I'm going to validate something you might be feeling right now:

This is exhausting. I created a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that ends the cycle. It takes 30 minutes to apply to your entire resume.

The endless applications. The hope. The rejection. The silence. Repeat.

You did everything you were supposed to do. Got the degree. Did internships. Pulled all-nighters. And now you're stuck in a loop that feels like it has no exit.

Here's the thing: it does have an exit. And it's simpler than you think.

The problem isn't the market. It's not your experience. It's 14 bullet points on a piece of paper that don't communicate any measurable value.

When every bullet says "Assisted with..." — you're invisible. When they say "Reduced defect rate by 23% by implementing automated test protocols" — you get calls.

Karen was in this exact loop. Then she applied the formula: Google, SpaceX, Bridgestone.

Sarah too. $106K at Ford.

I know what it feels like to apply to 50+ engineering jobs and hear nothing back.

That's why I built the Impact Bullet Builder — a free 14-page guide that fixes the exact thing that's causing the silence. It takes 30 minutes.

The cycle is brutal: find a job posting, tailor the cover letter (again), submit, wait, get rejected or ghosted, start over. Every round chips away at your confidence a little more.

But here's the part most people don't see: the problem was never your qualifications. It was 14 bullet points on your resume that said "Assisted with..." instead of showing measurable impact.

Hiring managers spend 6 seconds scanning. If nothing stops them — they move on. It's not personal. It's a volume game, and your resume is losing it.

The Impact Bullet Builder rewrites every bullet using a formula: accomplishment + metric + method + business impact.

Karen applied it. 4 offers including Google.
Sarah applied it. $106K at Ford.

Your engineering degree cost you 4+ years and up to $200K. And right now, it's sitting in a drawer.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that fixes the real problem. Grab it below — it takes 30 minutes.

"Get an engineering degree," they said. "Engineers always get jobs," they said.

Nobody told you the degree was just the ticket to the game — not a guarantee you'd win.

You feel cheated. And honestly? You should. Your university taught you thermodynamics and signal processing but not how to get hired. Career services gave you a resume template and said "good luck."

That template is the problem.

Generic bullet points like "Utilized SolidWorks for design modifications" tell a recruiter nothing. You blend in with the other 500 applicants. 6 seconds of attention — wasted.

Karen's degree was going unused. She used the Impact Bullet Builder to rewrite her resume. Then: 4 offers — including Google, SpaceX, and Bridgestone.

Sarah was an underpaid intern. Then: $106K at Ford.

Engineers — your degree cost 4+ years and $50K–$200K.

I created a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that makes sure that investment pays off. It rewrites every bullet on your resume in 30 minutes.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: nobody is hiring you because of your degree. They're hiring the person who can communicate what they accomplished with that degree.

"Assisted with testing" doesn't prove you're worth $80K/year.
"Reduced warranty claims by 31% by redesigning the thermal management system" does.

The difference is a formula. And 95% of engineering graduates were never taught it.

Your university taught you how to solve differential equations. Not how to sell your engineering skills on a resume. Career services handed you a template from 2015. That template is why you sound identical to every other applicant.

Let's do the math on your engineering degree:

→ 4+ years of your life

I built a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that turns that investment into job offers. 14 pages. 30 minutes to apply.

The degree wasn't supposed to end here. You were supposed to graduate and have companies lining up. Instead, you're competing against 500 people for every opening and hearing nothing back.

The problem? Your resume communicates duties instead of outcomes. "Collaborated with cross-functional teams" appears on every engineering resume in the country. It tells the recruiter absolutely nothing.

The Impact Bullet Builder teaches a formula that rewrites every bullet into a specific, measurable accomplishment. It works on internships, class projects, research, and part-time work.
