                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What majors do you work with?</h3>
                    <p>All engineering majors! Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, Civil, Chemical, Aerospace, etc. I have personal experience pivoting from Mechanical to Software, so I understand diverse engineering backgrounds.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you only help students targeting FAANG?</h3>
                    <p>Not at all! While I can help with FAANG prep, my specialty is large traditional engineering companies (automotive, aerospace, ag-tech, manufacturing) that are becoming tech-forward. Think Boeing, Caterpillar, GM, etc.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How far in advance should I start?</h3>
                    <p>Ideally 3-6 months before career fairs or application deadlines. But I've helped students prep in 2 weeks before an interview. The sooner, the better!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I don't have much experience?</h3>
                    <p>Perfect! That's exactly who this is for. We'll work with what you have—projects, coursework, internships, clubs—and present it in the most compelling way.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
                    <p>If you're not satisfied after the first session, I'll refund your full package cost. My goal is to help you succeed, and if we're not the right fit, no hard feelings.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you provide career coaching after I land a job?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Many students transition to the Accelerate track once hired to focus on early career growth and promotions. But that's optional—this package is focused on landing the job.</p>
