If you're an engineer or soon to graduate and become one, you've probably been told that if you just 'work hard' and keep your head down, you'll eventually get promoted. I found out the hard way that isn't necessarily true. Most engineering careers don't stall because of a lack of talent. They stall because of a lack of strategy.

My name is Mansour (pronounced MUN-SOOR). I've spent the last 7 years at John Deere, going from an entry-level Mechanical Engineer to a Software Development Leader. Along the way, I managed to get 4 promotions and executed 4 major career pivots. I didn't do it by being the smartest person in the room, as a matter of fact, I rarely was and rarely am. I did it by paying attention and using a system—a specific framework to build impact and visiblity, adding real value while making sure the right people were aware of it.

I have shared that same framework with many other engineers along the way to do the same. And now I am sharing it with a much wider audience.  Whether you are a student trying to Launch your first role, a professional trying to Pivot domains without going back to school, or a senior engineer trying to Accelerate into leadership...I have built a specific strategy to help get you there, which we can cover in 4 weeks.

I don't believe in generic advice. So, if you're serious about fixing your career trajectory, scroll down and sign up for a free 15 minute Strategy Call. Let's look at your specific situation and see if we can build your strategy together. I'm Mansour, and I look forward to meeting you.
