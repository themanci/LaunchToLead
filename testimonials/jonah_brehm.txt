Some background (from Mansour):

On Jonah Brehm (brehmjonah@gmail.com):
I coached Jonah when he was an entry level engineer at John Deere, and he landed a job as a Software Test Engineer within John Deere after my mentorship.  He did an amazing pivot from Mechanical to Software with my coaching.

On Mohamed Ibrahim (hamada201267@gmail.co):
I coached Mohamed a lot over the years.  He started as an entry level contract engineer at John Deere, and with my coaching he landed a permanent salaried enginering entry level role.  Then he was able to pivot from mechanical CI to a software role within the company.  I helped him a lot with interview preperation and learning new software skills to become competitive in the corporate landscape.
