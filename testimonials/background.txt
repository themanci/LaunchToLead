Some background (from Mansour):

On Jonah Brehm (brehmjonah@gmail.com):
I coached Jonah when he was an entry level engineer at John Deere, and he landed a job as a Software Test Engineer within John Deere after my mentorship.  He did an amazing pivot from Mechanical to Software with my coaching.

On Mohamed Ibrahim (hamada201267@gmail.co):
I coached Mohamed a lot over the years.  He started as an entry level contract engineer at John Deere, and with my coaching he landed a permanent salaried enginering entry level role.  Then he was able to pivot from mechanical CI to a software role within the company.  I helped him a lot with interview preperation and learning new software skills to become competitive in the corporate landscape.

On Cole Hunzeker (chunzeker24@gmail.com):
Cole is a coworker at John Deere.  He came to me seeking advice on how to get promoted.  He felt like he got passed up for promotion already a couple of times when he was very qualified for a promotion.  We worked on a lot of things together using my Accelerate strategies.  We also did a lot of interview prep.  He is not well equipped to pounce on the next promotion opportunity that comes his way.

On Chiebuka Onyejesi (chiebukaonyejesi@gmail.com):
Chiebuka, or Ebuka for short, was an Intern at Deere that I coached.  He came in not knowing a lot about networking and doing the right things to get his name and reputation elevated and positioned to get a return offer to come back to Deere full time.  We covered a lot of ground from my Launch framework, and he worked hard to implement a lot of the concepts there.  He is back in school now and graduating soon.  He has a lot of good tools now and is positioned well to get a great job when he graduates.

Murilo Baptistella (mucabap@gmail.com):
Murilo is a senior engineer at John Deere that I coached.  He was struggling with positioning himself to get a promotion, also to position himself to get deeper into a more software technical role.  He had a lot of technical knowledge, and a ton of drive.  What he was lacking was building his visibility, which I coached him through.  Also, buildling the right relationships that would pay off in 6-12 months.  After our coaching he was also able to get his manager to give him a technician who would work under him and Murilo would give him work direction.  I gave him this great strategy as part of the Trojan Horse strategy, he now has a change to prove he can manage someone even without getting a promotion to be a manager on paper. Murilo is very well positioned to pounce on the next promotion opportunity when it comes his way.

On Sarah Korssa (sarah.korssa@gmail.com):
Sarah Korssa was an intern that I coached at Deere and we spent many sessions together.  We revamped resume, interview prep, interview skills, etc.  She graduated and was landed a great job as a Process Engineer at Ford Motor Company with the help of my coaching.  Base salay for this role is $93k, with total comp starting around $106k.

On AJ Marsiglio (aj.marsiglio@yahoo.com):
I coached AJ and he managed to go from an entry level engineer to a level 2 in around 18 months from when we started.  He had issues with taking ownership of his situation and he wsa also not put in a place to succeed with the workload he was thrown into.  He managed to become very accountable and productive in a short amount of time.  He also stepped up and took over an entire product line in his role, using the trojan horse method to take on more work, to drive a promotion, instead of waiting for the promotion to take on more responsibility.  He got much better at communication, influencing without authority, leading initiatives, and working his skip level managers to bring forth great ideas that got him good recognition.  He did an amazing turn around in 18 months.  Many colleagues and managers noticed his shift and praised him a lot along the way.  A great turnaround.
