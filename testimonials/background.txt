Some background (from Mansour):

On Jonah Brehm (brehmjonah@gmail.com):
I coached Jonah when he was an entry level engineer at John Deere, and he landed a job as a Software Test Engineer within John Deere after my mentorship.  He did an amazing pivot from Mechanical to Software with my coaching.

On Mohamed Ibrahim (hamada201267@gmail.co):
I coached Mohamed a lot over the years.  He started as an entry level contract engineer at John Deere, and with my coaching he landed a permanent salaried enginering entry level role.  Then he was able to pivot from mechanical CI to a software role within the company.  I helped him a lot with interview preperation and learning new software skills to become competitive in the corporate landscape.

On Cole Hunzeker (chunzeker24@gmail.com):
Cole is a coworker at John Deere.  He came to me seeking advice on how to get promoted.  He felt like he got passed up for promotion already a couple of times when he was very qualified for a promotion.  We worked on a lot of things together using my Accelerate strategies.  We also did a lot of interview prep.  He is not well equipped to pounce on the next promotion opportunity that comes his way.

On Chiebuka Onyejesi (chiebukaonyejesi@gmail.com):
Chiebuka, or Ebuka for short, was an Intern at Deere that I coached.  He came in not knowing a lot about networking and doing the right things to get his name and reputation elevated and positioned to get a return offer to come back to Deere full time.  We covered a lot of ground from my Launch framework, and he worked hard to implement a lot of the concepts there.  He is back in school now and graduating soon.  He has a lot of good tools now and is positioned well to get a great job when he graduates.
