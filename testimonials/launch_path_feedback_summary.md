## 1. Positive Feedback (What They Loved)

### Coaching Style & Mansour's Delivery
- **Mohammed:** "Every session had great vibes and was professional enough that meaningful work was consistently being done, but also relaxed enough to feel welcoming and low-pressure." He also said: "I feel like I've made a friend rather than a 'connection'... Jazakallahkhair!"
- **Mohammed:** Appreciated how Mansour "critiqued my work, often offering very helpful feedback in a non-offensive manner that focused on growth rather than criticism."
- **Osaid:** "He has a lot of experience and learning from his experiences has been very valuable. His professionalism and kindness and flexibility are also very valuable."
- **Both:** Rated coaching style 5/5.

### Resume Transformation (Session 1)
- **Mohammed:** "I was able to transform my resume into something more powerful and career-fair ready." Found the hands-on work in the latter part of the session most valuable.
- **Osaid:** Specifically called out "the accomplishment metric how and why strategy" (the Impact Equation).
- **Both:** Listed "My resume is significantly stronger" as a key outcome.

### Mock Interview & Practice (Session 3)
- **Mohammed:** Rated 5/5. Loved the snap in/out of "interview mode" and real-time critique: "I was able to see instant improvement this session after being given tips like having a timer, having a few bullet points, being structured with my story, learning lessons, and 'back in time'."
- **Osaid:** Rated 5/5. "Being able to practice in the mock interview is definitely very beneficial in building confidence."
- **Both:** This is the highest-rated session. Live practice is the #1 value driver.

### Story Mastery
- **Mohammed:** Valued dissecting stories to "paint me as the hero of the story." The AI microphone suggestion for brain-dumping stories was a game-changer: "this proved to be really helpful in sessions 3 and the extension session."
- **Osaid:** "Being able to practice and some of the feedback given to make my story's better." Also: "I understand more of the recruiter's mindset when they are interviewing."

### Structured Approach
- **Mohammed:** "The biggest change I experienced was gaining a structured and repeatable approach to both resume building and interview preparation."
- **Both:** Listed increased confidence and better stories as key transformations.

### Materials
- **Mohammed:** Resume transformation materials, story vault, story evaluation framework (2-star vs 5-star ranking system), and the application pipeline were all called out as valuable.
- **Osaid:** Interview practice materials rated highest. Pre-Session 2 materials (Story Vault Template) rated 5/5.

---

## 2. Negative Feedback / Pain Points

### Pre-Work Can Feel Tedious (Mohammed)
- "I said an 8 [on NPS] because I do believe that some of the 'pre-work' can be tedious and long and some may see it as that."
- **Nuance:** He immediately adds that "a majority of the homework is VERY beneficial." The issue is the initial perception of length, not the quality.

### Session 2 Was the Weakest Session (Mohammed)
- Rated 3/5 (lowest of all session ratings across both respondents).
- The pre/post Session 2 materials were also rated 3/5 by Mohammed.
- **Root cause:** The first part of the session was less valuable; the hands-on dissection of stories in the second half was the real value. Suggests the session front-loads theory too much before getting to practice.

### Job Search Tracking (Osaid)
- The job search tracker materials were "the least helpful" to Osaid specifically because clients are told to *create* the spreadsheet rather than being given a ready-made template: "Instead of just telling the people create the excel file to track the job search I would say giving a template of the excel file for them to use would have been helpful and would save them a lot of time."

### Materials Are Too Static / Not Interactive (Osaid)
- "The pre materials they are just an HTML page with valuable information in it of course but I would suggest make it a little more interactive so that the people aren't only reading. Make videos giving that same information."
- Wants multimedia (video walkthroughs) layered on top of the existing written materials.

### Materials Not Reviewed in Sessions Feel Wasted (Mohammed)
- "Materials that were not directly reviewed or applied during the sessions were less helpful, as they were harder to fully implement independently."
- If it's not workshopped live, some clients won't go deep on it alone.

## 3. Suggestions (What They Want Added)

### 🔵 Homework Review Time at Start of Sessions (Mohammed)
> "I would suggest adding a brief 'homework review' (around 10 minutes) at the beginning of each session to help keep track of pre-session work and ensure everyone is aligned."

### 🔵 LinkedIn Makeover / Networking Content (Mohammed)
> "Thinking back, I am also really interested in a LinkedIn make-over, this would be really helpful to add."
> Also: "Especially the earlier material that covers networking and LinkedIn."
> He listed LinkedIn and resume as things he wished they'd spent more time on.

### 🔵 Pre-Built Job Search Tracker Template (Osaid)
> "Giving a template of the excel file for them to use would have been helpful and would save them a lot of time. You would only have to make the template once and then you can reuse it with everybody."

### 🔵 Video Walkthroughs for Pre-Session Materials (Osaid)
> "Consider adding some videos... Make videos giving that same information. You would only have to make the video once and then keep it on the page."

### 🔵 Discipline-Specific Project Guidance (Mohammed)
> "I personally would have benefited from examples that were more directly related to engines and machinery systems, as that is the area I am most interested in pursuing."

### 🔵 More Resume Workshop Time (Mohammed)
> "Adding a second session focused on resume work could be valuable, particularly to allow more time for refinement and feedback."

### 🔵 Extension Session Format (Mohammed)
> Found the 4th (extension) session "extremely helpful as a second opportunity to run through the mock interview." Suggests this should be a standard part of the program, not an add-on.

## 4. Actions We Can Take

### Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Impact)
| Action | Source | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Add 10-min homework review at the start of each session** | Mohammed | None (process change) | Ensures alignment, makes pre-work feel valued |
| **Create a pre-built Google Sheets job tracker template** | Osaid | 1-2 hours | Eliminates the #1 least-helpful material complaint |
| **Make the 4th mock interview session standard** | Mohammed | Schedule change | His confidence jump was dramatic between session 3 and 4 |
| **Front-load Session 2 with more practice, less theory** | Mohammed (3/5 rating) | Restructure | Address the weakest-rated session |

### Medium Effort (Build Once, Use Forever)
| Action | Source | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Record video walkthroughs for each pre-session material** | Osaid | 3-5 hours total | Makes materials interactive; record once, reuse for every client |
| **Add a LinkedIn profile optimization section** | Mohammed | 2-3 hours (content + worksheet) | Fills the most-requested gap; crossover with Accelerate path |
| **Create discipline-specific project suggestion banks** | Mohammed | 3-4 hours (research per discipline) | MechE, EE, SWE, Civil — makes recommendations more personalized |

### Strategic (Program Evolution)
| Action | Source | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Consider 4-session standard format** (Resume, Stories, Mock 1, Mock 2) | Mohammed | Pricing/packaging change | Both clients valued practice most — adding a 2nd mock is the highest-leverage move |
| **Build a "pre-work expectations" guide** to reduce tedium perception | Mohammed | 1 hour | Frame pre-work as "the investment that makes sessions 3x more valuable" |
| **Shorten/gamify pre-work** where possible | Mohammed | Varies | Reduce length without losing substance; consider interactive checklists vs. long reads |

## 5. Cross-Reference with Lead Magnet Brainstorm (10 New Ideas)

### Direct Matches: Feedback Validates These Ideas ✅

| Brainstorm Idea | Feedback That Validates It | Client |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------|
| **#2 — Job Search Command Center (Google Sheets Template)** | "Instead of just telling the people create the excel file to track the job search I would say giving a template..." — This is EXACTLY what idea #2 is. Osaid literally asked for it. | Osaid |
| **#1 — STAR+2 Story Vault Builder** | Mohammed loved the story dissection, the story ranking system (2-star vs 5-star), and specifically called out "learning lessons" and "back in time" — the exact +2 additions. | Mohammed |
| **#8 — LinkedIn Profile Audit for Engineers** | "I am also really interested in a LinkedIn make-over, this would be really helpful to add." Requested multiple times by Mohammed. | Mohammed |
| **#10 — Behavioral Interview Question Bank** | Both clients rated mock interview as the #1 value driver. A question bank supports self-practice between sessions. Osaid: "The most helpful material was the interview practice Materials." | Both |

### Indirect Matches: Feedback Supports These Ideas 🟡

| Brainstorm Idea | How Feedback Supports It |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **#3 — Networking Script Playbook** | Mohammed wished they'd spent more time on "networking and LinkedIn." Scripts would fill this gap as a self-serve resource. |
| **#5 — Application Timing Cheat Sheet** | Mohammed valued the "structured job search approach" and called the application pipeline helpful. A timing cheat sheet extends this. |
| **#9 — First 90 Days Playbook** | Mohammed is "definitely" interested in Accelerate Path. Osaid says "maybe later." A First 90 Days guide bridges Launch → Accelerate naturally. |

### No Direct Signal (But Still Strong Ideas) ⚪

| Brainstorm Idea | Note |
|----------------|------|
| **#4 — Engineering Career Path Atlas** | Neither client mentioned career path confusion, but they're both early-stage (pre-job). May resonate more with career changers. |
| **#6 — Salary Negotiation Toolkit** | Neither has reached the offer stage yet ("No interviews... YET!"). Relevant later in funnel. |
| **#7 — New Grad Company Hit List** | Not mentioned, but both would benefit from it — Mohammed was "dry applying" before the program. |

## 6. NEW Lead Magnet Ideas (From Feedback — NOT in Our Brainstorm)

These are gaps surfaced by Mohammed and Osaid that are **not covered** by any of our existing 10 brainstorm ideas, 8 backlog ideas, or 6 existing lead magnets.

---

### NEW IDEA A: 🎥 The Pre-Session Video Walkthrough Series
**Source:** Osaid's suggestion — "make videos giving that same information... you would only have to make the video once"
**What It Is:** Short (3-5 min) video walkthroughs for each pre-session module — Resume Self-Eval, Story Vault, Mock Prep — that make the static HTML materials come alive.
**Lead Magnet Angle:** Could be repurposed as a free "Launch Path Preview" video series — gives potential clients a taste of the coaching before they buy. Think "free masterclass" energy.
**Why It's New:** None of our brainstorm ideas are video-based. This is a format innovation, not just a topic innovation.
**Action:** Record once → embed in pre-session materials → repurpose as top-of-funnel content.

---

### NEW IDEA B: 🔧 The Engineering Project Idea Bank (By Discipline)
**Source:** Mohammed's feedback — "I personally would have benefited from examples that were more directly related to engines and machinery systems."
**What It Is:** A curated bank of portfolio-worthy project ideas organized by engineering discipline (MechE, EE, SWE, Civil, Aerospace, etc.). Each project includes:
- What to build
- Why it's impressive to employers
- Which skills it demonstrates
- Estimated time to complete
- How to write it as an Impact Equation bullet on your resume
**Lead Magnet Angle:** Students constantly ask "what projects should I do?" This answers it definitively, by discipline.
**Why It's New:** None of our 10 brainstorm ideas or 8 backlog ideas cover project selection/portfolio building. This fills a clear gap in the Launch path.
**Action:** Start with SWE + MechE (highest demand), expand to other disciplines.

---

### NEW IDEA C: 🧠 The Recruiter Mindset Decoder
**Source:** Osaid's transformation — "I understand more of the recruiter's mindset when they are interviewing. So now I tell my stories and interview according to that."
**What It Is:** A concise guide that reveals how recruiters and hiring managers actually evaluate candidates — the scoring rubrics, the time they spend per section, the red/green flags, the biases. Think: "what the interviewer is *really* thinking when they ask you [X]."
**Lead Magnet Angle:** Flips the script from "how to answer questions" to "how interviewers score your answers." This is insider knowledge that feels forbidden.
**Why It's New:** Our STAR+2 and Question Bank teach *how to answer*. This teaches *how you're being evaluated* — the meta-layer. Different lens, different value.
**Action:** Could be a 4-5 page guide with real scoring rubrics from FAANG, defense, and mid-size companies.

---

### NEW IDEA D: 📋 The Pre-Work Playbook (How to Get 3x More Out of Coaching)
**Source:** Mohammed's note that pre-work "can be tedious" + materials not reviewed in sessions "were harder to fully implement independently."
**What It Is:** A 2-3 page meta-guide on *how to approach pre-work* — not the content itself, but the mindset and strategy for getting maximum value from self-study materials. Includes:
- The 80/20 rule for pre-work (what to focus on, what to skim)
- How to come to a session with 3 specific questions
- The "10-min homework summary" format (prepare a quick verbal review)
- Why the work you do between sessions is where 70% of the transformation happens
**Lead Magnet Angle:** This could be a free "How to Get the Most Out of Any Coaching Program" guide — positions Mansour as the coach who cares about your results, not just selling sessions.
**Why It's New:** None of our brainstorm ideas address the *meta-skill* of being a good coaching client. This is a trust-builder.
**Action:** Quick build (1 hour). Could also improve client outcomes within the paid program.

## Summary: The Feedback in One Sentence Each

**Mohammed:** *"The structured framework and Mansour's coaching style transformed my resume and interview confidence — I just wish we had more time for resume workshopping, LinkedIn, and reviewing pre-work together."*
