Gavin's comments:

During my internship, I was incredibly fortunate to have a manager like Mansour who was interested in helping develop my career skills. He took the time to share thoughtful early-career advice, covering everything from navigating potential interviews to understanding how to advocate for myself and learn in ways I wouldn't have even thought of asking for help with. What stood out the most was how open he was about his own career journey. Hearing the honest ups and downs of how he got to where he is made his guidance feel real, grounded, and genuinely motivating.

What I appreciated most was that his coaching didn't feel scripted or generic. He always met me where I was, helped me think through challenges with clarity, and encouraged me to look at my long-term path with more intention and confidence. That level of support had a lasting impact on me, and I still apply many of the pieces of advice he gave me today. Anyone who works with him will be getting a coach who truly listens, shares generously, and believes in helping people reach their full potential.

Thank you for all your help,
Gavin
