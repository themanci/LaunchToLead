## Structural Framework (Hormozi Method Applied)

| Beat | Hormozi Principle | Our Application |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Open with recognized pain | The void — applying and hearing nothing |
| 2 | Name the problem + credibility | "The Invisible Engineer" — and why I know |
| 3 | Categories of the problem | 4 places your job search is broken |
| 4 | Cost of inaction | $6,700/month + confidence erosion |
| 5 | The system + what you get | 21-Day Blueprint — 3 sessions, specific deliverables |
| 6 | Social proof + guarantee | Real results, honest disclaimer, risk reversal |
| 7 | Low-friction CTA | Book a call, see if it's a fit |

## The Script

### BEAT 1: Open With Recognized Pain
*(Camera: Direct to camera. No intro music. No logo. Just talking.)*

So you've been applying to jobs for weeks — maybe months — and you're hearing... nothing.

You hit submit, refresh your inbox for three days, and quietly accept that another one went into the void.

Meanwhile your classmates are getting offers. You had the same GPA. The same classes. And you can't figure out what they're doing differently.

Then someone at dinner asks, "So, how's the job search going?" — and you have to smile and say "still looking" again. And the worst part? You start wondering if something is actually wrong with *you*.

If any of that sounds familiar — stay with me.

### BEAT 2: The Core Problem + Credibility
*(Slight lean in.)*

My name's Mansour. I'm a mechanical engineer. Seven years at a Fortune 100 company — four promotions, four career pivots. And I've sat on both sides of the hiring table. I've reviewed resumes. I've made hiring decisions.

And here's what I've learned: the number one reason qualified engineers don't get hired isn't their skills, their GPA, or the market. It's that they're *invisible*.

Engineering school taught you thermodynamics and data structures. It taught you nothing about communicating your value to someone deciding whether to spend $80,000 a year on you.

So you write a resume that reads like a job description — "Assisted with development," "Participated in testing" — and a hiring manager thinks: "Okay, you showed up. But what did you actually *do*?"

You did real work. But nothing on your resume proves it. So you look exactly like the other 400 people who applied.

---

### BEAT 3: The Four Places It's Broken
*(Counting on fingers.)*

Every engineer I coach is making the same four mistakes. I guarantee at least two apply to you right now.

**One: Your resume lists tasks, not proof.** "Responsible for quality testing" tells a hiring manager nothing. "Reduced defect escape rate 34% by designing an automated inspection protocol — saving $200K annually" — that's the same work. One gets ignored. The other gets a callback.

**Two: You're applying into the void.** 75% of resumes get rejected by ATS before a human sees them. And 70-80% of engineering jobs are filled through referrals *before they're ever posted*. If your strategy is LinkedIn Easy Apply on repeat, you're fishing in an empty pond.

**Three: You can't tell your story under pressure.** An interviewer says "Tell me about a time..." and your mind goes blank. Or you ramble for four minutes. It's not about being smart enough — it's about having a system *before* you walk in.

**Four: You're leaving money on the table.** Engineering salaries have a $15K-$30K negotiation range and companies *expect* you to negotiate. When you don't, you're not being humble. You're just costing yourself money.

---

### BEAT 4: The Cost of Staying Invisible
*(More serious.)*

Let's do the math most people skip.

Entry-level engineering salary: $80,000. That's $6,700 a month. Every month without that job, you're losing $6,700. Six months? That's $40,000.

And it's not just money. It's the confidence erosion. Every rejection chips away at how you see yourself. Meanwhile, AI is shrinking entry-level roles. The barrier gets higher every month. The resume gap gets wider. This compounds — and that's the part nobody tells you.

---

### BEAT 5: The System + What You Get
*(Energy shift. Solution mode.)*

So I packaged everything I know into a system: the 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint.

Three weeks. Three 90-minute 1-on-1 coaching sessions. Each one produces a specific deliverable you walk away with.

**Week 1: The Resume Rebuild.** We reconstruct your resume using the Impact Bullet Builder — which you already got a taste of. Every bullet rewritten to show accomplishments with numbers, methods, and outcomes. Not tasks. Not duties.

**Week 2: The Interview Weaponization.** We build your Competency Story Map — 15+ STAR examples organized by competency. When they ask "Tell me about a time..." you pick from your menu and deliver a tight 90-second answer. We practice until it's automatic.

**Week 3: The Live Roast.** Full mock behavioral interview the way a real hiring manager would run it. Direct feedback. Plus salary negotiation scripts so you don't leave $15K on the table.

You also get 52 proprietary methods and 40 bonus templates, checklists, and guides.

This is not a motivational seminar. Not a 47-module course you'll never finish. This is me working directly on *your* resume, *your* stories, *your* interview performance. And spots are limited to 10 per month.

---

### BEAT 6: Social Proof + Guarantee
*(Warmer.)*

One client went from feeling stuck and insecure to landing offers from SpaceX, Google, GE, and Bridgestone. Another went from new grad with no clear path to $106K total comp at Ford. Another pivoted from mechanical to software — without changing companies or taking a pay cut.

These aren't unicorns. They had the same problem you have. They just got the system.

Now — I can't promise a six-figure offer in three weeks. I can't control the market. But I *can* promise you'll leave with a transformed resume, 15+ interview stories ready to deploy, and a completed mock interview. And if you do the work and don't walk away with those deliverables — I keep coaching you at no extra charge until you do.

---

### BEAT 7: CTA
*(Calm. No pressure.)*

There's never a perfect time to do this. Every month you wait is another $6,700 you didn't earn and another month the gap widens.

Below this video there's a short form — takes two minutes. If we're a good fit, you can book a free 15-minute strategy call. We'll talk about where you're stuck and whether the Blueprint makes sense for you. If it does, great. If not, I'll still point you in the right direction.

No pressure. No pitch. Just a conversation between two engineers.

If you're tired of the void — I'll talk to you soon.

## Production Notes

### Filming Guidelines
- **Setting:** Clean, professional background. Home office or simple backdrop — should feel real.
- **Framing:** Chest-up, slightly off-center. Eye-level camera.
- **Wardrobe:** Smart casual. Button-up or polo. No suit.
- **Delivery:** Conversational, not scripted-sounding. Natural pauses are good.
- **Energy arc:** Empathetic (1) → authoritative (2-3) → serious (4) → solution energy (5) → warm (6) → grounded (7)

### Key Stats to Display On-Screen
- $6,700/month in lost income
- 75% of resumes auto-rejected by ATS
- 70-80% of jobs filled before they're posted
- $15K-$30K negotiation range for entry-level engineering

### Estimated Runtime
- Beat 1 (Pain): ~0:45
- Beat 2 (Problem + Credibility): ~1:00
