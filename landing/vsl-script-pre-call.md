# VSL Script — Pre-Discovery Call Video

> **Purpose:** Video for the booking confirmation page (`landing/booking-confirmed.html`). Shown after someone books a Career Launch Call.
> **Target Length:** 5-6 minutes (~900-1,100 words spoken)
> **Audience:** Engineers who already booked a discovery call — they're interested but may have doubts
> **Goal:** Overcome objections before the call, reduce basic questions, prime them to come prepared
> **Tone:** Warm, direct, reassuring, engineer-to-engineer — NOT salesy

| 2 | Address the #1 objection: "Is this a sales pitch?" | Defuses skepticism, builds trust |
| 3 | Address objection: "I can figure this out myself" | Shows the cost of DIY with real math |

## The Script

### BEAT 1: Congratulate + Set the Frame
*(Camera: Direct to camera. Warm, genuine energy. Slight smile.)*

Hey — congrats on booking your Career Launch Call. I mean that. Most engineers think about getting help for weeks, sometimes months, and never actually take the step. You just did. That already puts you ahead.

I want to use this quick video to make sure our call is as productive as possible. I'm going to cover a few things people usually ask me in the first five minutes — so we can skip the basics and get straight into *your* situation.

This will take about five minutes. It's worth it.

---

### BEAT 2: "Is This Going to Be a Sales Pitch?"
*(Lean in slightly. Honest, direct.)*

Let me address the thing you might be thinking: "Is this call just going to be a sales pitch?"

No. Here's what actually happens.

I'm going to ask you about your situation — where you are in your career, what you've been doing, what's not working. Then I'm going to give you honest feedback. I'll tell you exactly what I think the problem is and what I'd do to fix it.

If the 21-Day Blueprint is a good fit — I'll tell you. If it's not — I'll tell you that too, and I'll still point you in the right direction. I've turned people away when I didn't think coaching was the right move for them. Ask anyone who's talked to me.

This call is a conversation, not a pitch. I'm an engineer. I don't do high-pressure sales tactics — I find them as uncomfortable as you do.

---

### BEAT 3: "Can't I Just Figure This Out Myself?"
*(Straightforward. Not judgmental.)*

Here's the other thing I hear a lot: "I think I can probably figure this out on my own."

And honestly? You probably can. Eventually. The information exists. You can find resume advice on YouTube. You can google "how to answer behavioral questions." It's all out there.

But here's what I've seen over and over: engineers who try the DIY route spend three to six months doing it. Three to six months of trial and error, guessing what's working, wondering why they're not getting callbacks.

Let's do the math. If your target salary is $80,000 a year, every month you spend "figuring it out" costs you $6,700 in income you're not earning. Three months? That's $20,000. Six months? $40,000.

The question isn't whether you *can* figure it out alone. It's whether you can afford the time it takes.

The engineers I work with don't come to me because they're not smart enough. They come because they want to compress six months of guessing into 21 days of doing it right the first time.

### BEAT 4: "I'm Not Sure I Can Afford Coaching"
*(Empathetic. Not dismissive.)*

Now — I know investment is on your mind. And I respect that. You're probably a student or early in your career, and money matters.

So let me give you some context without getting into specific numbers — because we'll cover the details on our call.

The coaching is a one-time investment. We have a pay-in-full option and a payment plan that lets you split it across your sessions — so you're not paying everything upfront.

But here's how I'd think about it as an engineer. Run the ROI.

If coaching helps you land a job even one month faster than you would have on your own — at an $80,000 salary, that's $6,700 you earned back. Most of my clients would tell you they got there faster than that.

And if it helps you negotiate even $5,000 more in salary? That's not a one-time gain. That compounds every year for the rest of your career. Over 10 years, a $5K salary bump is $50,000 or more.

I'm not asking you to decide right now. That's what the call is for. I just want you to think about it as an investment with a measurable return — not an expense.

### BEAT 5: Client Results
*(Warmer. Pride in the work.)*

Let me tell you about some real people I've worked with — because I think it'll help you see where you could be in a few weeks.

Karen came to me feeling completely stuck and insecure about her job search. After going through the Blueprint, she landed interviews and offers from SpaceX, Google, GE, and Bridgestone. Not one — *four* major companies wanted her. Same person, same degree — she just learned how to communicate her value.

Sarah was a new grad with no clear direction. We rebuilt her resume, built her interview stories, and ran mock interviews until she was sharp. She landed a Process Engineer role at Ford Motor Company — $106,000 total compensation as a new grad.

Jonah was a mechanical engineer who wanted to pivot into software but had no idea how to make that transition. We worked through the positioning together, and he landed a Software Test Engineer role at John Deere — without changing companies or taking a pay cut. Zero percent chance he makes that pivot without a system.

AJ was an entry-level engineer who was working hard but getting zero recognition. He felt invisible. We worked on visibility, communication, and self-advocacy — and he went from being overlooked to getting promoted to Engineer II in 18 months. His managers and colleagues noticed the shift immediately.

Gavin was an intern when I coached him. We worked on interview prep, self-advocacy, and career strategy. He landed a Software Engineer position at a Fortune 500 national security company.

These are real engineers. Real results. And every single one of them started exactly where you are right now — wondering if this could actually work for them.

### BEAT 6: Come Prepared — What to Think About
*(Shift to practical. Coaching-mode energy.)*

Okay — here's how you can make our call really count.

Before we talk, I want you to think about three things. You don't need to have perfect answers. Just start thinking.

**First: your dream roles.** What job titles actually excite you? Not what your parents think you should do — what do *you* want to wake up and work on? If you're not sure, that's fine. But if you have even a rough idea — bring it.

**Second: your dream companies.** If you could work anywhere, where would it be? Big tech? Automotive? Aerospace? A startup? A Fortune 500? Write down three to five companies you'd love to get an offer from. We can talk about strategy for each one.

**Third: your timeline.** When do you want to start your first coaching session? Are you ready now? After finals? Next month? This matters because I only take 10 clients per month — and some months fill up fast. Knowing your timeline helps me tell you honestly whether I have availability when you need it.

Jot these down before our call. Even bullet points on your phone. It'll make the 15 minutes we have together way more productive.

---

### BEAT 7: Scarcity + Close
*(Calm. Matter-of-fact. Not pushy.)*

One more thing I want to be upfront about.

I work with every client directly — every session is 1-on-1, with me. I don't have a team. I don't outsource the coaching. Because of that, I cap it at 10 clients per month. That's not a marketing line — it's a real constraint. Some months I'm booked out two to three weeks in advance.

So when we get on the call, if you're ready to move forward, I'll let you know exactly when I can start with you. And if I'm full, I'll get you on the waitlist for the next available slot.

I'm looking forward to our conversation. Come with your dream roles, your dream companies, and your timeline — and I'll come with a plan.

Talk to you soon.
