## The Script

*(Direct to camera. No intro. No music. Just go.)*

You just downloaded the guide. Good. That tells me something about you.

It tells me you know your resume isn't working. You've been applying — maybe for weeks, maybe months — and you're getting nothing back. No interviews. No callbacks. Just silence.

And the worst part? You did real work. You built things. You solved problems. But your resume doesn't prove any of it. So to a recruiter, you look exactly like the other 400 applicants.

That's the gap. And it's costing you $6,700 every single month you don't have your engineering job.

I'm Mansour. Mechanical engineer. Seven years at John Deere — four promotions, four pivots. I've sat on the other side of the hiring table and made the decisions. And I built a system that fixes this in 21 days.

Three weeks. Three 1-on-1 sessions with me. You walk away with a completely rebuilt resume, 15+ interview stories locked and loaded, and a live mock interview under your belt.

One client used it to land offers from SpaceX, Google, GE, and Bridgestone. Another went from new grad to $106K at Ford. These aren't outliers — they just got the system before you did.

It's $997. Three payments of $349 if you need it. Pays for itself your first week on the job.

And if you do the work and don't get results — I keep coaching you at no extra charge until you do.

I only take 10 people a month. Scroll down, answer three quick questions, and if you're a fit — book your free Career Launch Call.

No fluff. No pitch. Just two engineers talking.

I'll see you on the call.

## Production Notes

- **Length:** ~90-100 seconds at natural speaking pace
- **Setting:** Clean background, direct to camera, chest-up framing
- **Energy:** Start calm and empathetic (the pain), shift to confident and direct (the solution), close warm
- **Key moments to emphasize:** "$6,700 every single month" / "SpaceX, Google, GE, and Bridgestone" / "$997" / "10 people a month"
- **Do NOT:** Use filler words, say "um," pause too long, or sound scripted. Read it 5 times then put the script down and say it in your own words.
- **Wardrobe:** Professional casual. No suit. No hoodie. Engineer who knows what he's doing.
