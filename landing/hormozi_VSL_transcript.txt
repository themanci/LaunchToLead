Oh, I can't take a vacation without spending half your time on your laptop or delegating feel super risky because no one else kind of Knows it like you do and most of the company's knowledge You know exists inside of your head or maybe your team looks to you for every single answer even the tiny ones and you secretly Resent them for it Or you worry of what would happen to revenue if you got sick or disappeared for a month because all the sales of fulfillment rely On you maybe you feel guilty when you're with your family because you're not working and you feel guilty when you're working because our own Family and if that sounds at least familiar You have something that we call key members, which means that you're constantly working in the business and not on the business There's the number one reason why entrepreneurs can't scale and it's also why they can't sell their companies It's also why they feel trapped. It's after hosting over a thousand businesses here at headquarters in Vegas for the last two years I've noticed one very common theme that separates the entrepreneurs who scale fast From those who stays trapped for a long time Most of the owners think that they own a business when in reality, they're a very expensive high-paying job It's a key man risk is when a single person is vital to the business operating, right? So they're gone your business stops working and for some this risk shows up when growth explodes And it feels like the wheels are falling off the bus for others It's you know They're launching a new line and realizing that they don't have the systems in order to support it or they're starting and you know to try And consider an exit only to find out that the business is actually in cell This is something that I went through it's a key man risk is always painful But when you're doubling revenue, we're having a product line or for sale I can destroy everything that you've built and that's what founders realize they can't keep being the bottleneck And so just look at it like this your business is like a bridge, right? You have a thousand people on one side the thousand people on the other side of the bridge But if you are the bridge the second you leave everyone falls in the water and dies, right? Not great And so how do you know if you actually a key man risk? So I know this because what I'm trying to sell my company Jim on I was the key man And so for any potential acquirer like a private equity firm or institutional buyer having one person Especially the owner who's gonna leave is a massive red flag So they're thinking like we're buying this business but removing the one person that makes the same work No way, right? Even if it weren't a massive red flag, it'll just dramatically reduce the valuation of the business And so once I fixed this I was able to run my company off of one meeting a week now to be clear that didn't Happen overnight. It's a two years to get from me being involved in marketing sales ops We're creating all of it to me being able to have an executive team that could take the company continued growth to be profitable With just one hour getting that point resulted me selling the company for forty six point two million dollars It's a today on a portfolio companies that last year did over 250 million dollars in aggregate revenue And we implement these same systems across software local businesses e-commerce consumer services professional services home services medical services Probably a business like yours And so fundamentally if you sell online via checkout online over the phone in person with a salesperson self-checkout There's the only four ways you can sell stuff if you sell in any of those four ways We have worked with a business like yours many many times and so key man risk presents itself in four main areas So number one marketing so you're the only one who knows how to get leads or there's one person in the business who only knows how to get leads and if that person left the business is screwed the second is sales which is that you're The only person you can close leads and you may be this person that only you trust with customers Or that customers only trust you it doesn't really matter at the end of the day There's only one person who can close the third is product or delivery, right? You might be the the one person you can figure out these complex things You're some super genius or whatever You know thing that you sell is but that still makes you the bottleneck to everything that business delivers And then finally is fourth which is the operations, right? You're the only person you can hold everything together You're the glue you're the one that everyone respects and that if you were gone No one would keep the trains running on time. 

It'll leave a huge vacuum So here's the wall part the more valuable come and this is something that was like super painful for me Because i'm such a big like investor in self-education But the more valuable you become the more of a key man you become to your business So it's this double-edged sword and the better you get the worse it is for the business in a way, right? So the more places one person specifically maybe you the key man exists The riskier the business becomes overall and the less likely an acquirer is to buy it So here's what i've learned So as soon as you learn the system to rapidly removing key man risk, which you can do in a repeatable way you can unlock the ability to scale and Fast and so I think about like this Assembling companies and assembling people and then transferring skills around whatever area has a bottleneck where too few people know how to do The thing and so whether you want to sell your business or not making a business that sell a bull makes it better for everyone So business owners that want to scale and potentially just have the option for an exit all have one thing in common They are the bridge and then they ask a similarly worded question How do I stop being the bridge or how do I stop being the bottleneck or how do I stop being the constraint? And so the answer is well It depends on where you experience key man risk and the good news is though It doesn't matter which of the four that I mentioned it is there is a system to solve it And I know it because i've lived it and so that's why we ended up creating a scaling workshop It's a way for us to meet companies help them get through these exact problems where they're currently at in their industry and their size Business owners fly out to our headquarters in vegas to work with Our team hands-on over a two-day sprint to have them implement the system But here's the thing This is not a room, you know Like a big conference a big rah-rah that you know sit in the back and you take a bunch of notes, you know Or something like that. We work with a maximum of 100 businesses at a time I think the average around 80 ish and there's zero motivational talk to you like read all the reviews that we have online They're like zero high no bs. If anything you realize this is a lot But that's the reality like if there was one magic bullet that would actually get you to solve a business everyone would do it Whatever would do and so there's a process a sequence of steps that you can follow But some people call a system to getting from point a to point b And so we work directly on your business with your specific challenges And so that you can leave with your complete three to five step executive plan with owners timelines and everything built specifically to your business It's extremely tactical So imagine this instead of being the bridge that everything depends on your business runs on systems, right? And you can step away for a week or a month and the revenue continues to flow and you have a team that makes decisions Value content gets served the same quality and growth is predictable. 

This is the end goal here So you're no longer trapped in a high-paying job You actually own a true business that works for you not because of you now I can't promise that the rainbows are incumbent and unicorns are gonna You know carry off in the distance because the work's on you, right? But we can't show you how we do it and how we've done with our portfolio companies Across all these different industries across all these different sizes And so every day that you remain the key man, you are not building the business You're building a very comfortable prison which sucks, right? I get it because i've done it for a very long time and hey to be clear If you want to just continue to work that way, it's totally cool Like i'm king of like do whatever you want, right? But as long as you understand that's what you're getting into The thing is the people who come on to vigas to one of our workshops tend to be the ones who want to turn those Kind of like high-paying jobs into assets. They want to create something They want to build something that's separate from themselves something that is sellable if they so chose to The reality of this is that there's never going to be a perfect time In fact, these problems typically compound to get worse. That's usually when they're not addressed quickly You might be feeling that right now And so when you book a call you can reserve a priority ticket Even if you need a little time to pick the exact date It's one of the number one reasons people like i'm not sure if i should book out book on out Let's get a fit We'll see make sure that it works both ways and then we'll just make sure that there's a time that fits within your calendar All right And that way you don't get stuck waiting another 6 to 12 months while these problems continue to get worse done the right way The crazy thing is it's like hey, you know, my foot hurts once I go to see the doctor It's like well when my foot hurts even less it's like yeah, but reality It's like it's gonna be even harder to walk in the future And so sometimes the best day to fix a problem is today the problems do get worse And so many owners do come to us in the middle of a very busy season And that's totally fine because if you can learn how to fix the business in a busy season Then it'll be a breeze during an easy season No matter where you're at whether it's an easy season a middle season or a busy season and i've yet to meet a business owner Says it's an easy season. 

We'll structure your plans. It actually fits your timeline All right And so the key is deciding to fix it not waiting for the kind of like the mythical unicorn perfect moment because that we all Know never comes and so if you want to get our team's help our actual directors Who actually do this in our portfolio companies in our company go ahead. We'll call my team We'll see if it's a fit and if it is can't wait to meet you
