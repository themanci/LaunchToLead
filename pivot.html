                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does a typical pivot take?</h3>
                    <p>6-18 months depending on the disciplines and your starting point. My mechanical-to-software pivot took about 2 years for a full role change, but I was contributing to software projects within 6 months.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to leave my company to pivot?</h3>
                    <p>Not necessarily! Internal pivots are often easier because you have credibility and relationships. I'll help you navigate internal transfers strategically.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I don't have coding experience?</h3>
                    <p>That's exactly where I started! I'll recommend the right learning path based on your target role and provide realistic timelines.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I pivot while working full-time?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. That's how I did it. We'll create a realistic plan that fits your schedule—usually 5-10 hours per week of skill building.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if my company doesn't have openings in my target discipline?</h3>
                    <p>We'll develop a strategy for external opportunities while building skills internally. Your current role can still provide relevant project experience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will my mechanical background hurt me in software roles?</h3>
                    <p>The opposite! Cross-functional engineers are incredibly valuable. I'll show you how to pitch your unique perspective as a competitive advantage.</p>
