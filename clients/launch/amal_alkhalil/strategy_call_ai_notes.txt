Break and Academic Status Update Mansour Manci and Amal Alkhalil started with a brief exchange about Amal Alkhalil's break, which extends until the week of the 20th, providing them with a month for an interview (00:00:00). Amal Alkhalil clarified that they are currently in their fourth year but are behind and had to take many high school level classes; their expected graduation is now spring 2027, an extension caused by changing their major (00:03:05).
Major Changes and Career Interests Amal Alkhalil shared that they initially changed their major from undecided to software engineering, then to electrical engineering (00:03:05). They explained that the shift was due to a dislike for software engineering and input from others suggesting that the initially considered biomedical engineering was too niche. Amal Alkhalil settled on electrical engineering because it allows them to take biomedical-based classes like bio sensors, aligning with their interests (00:04:03) (00:11:26). Mansour Manci noted that Amal Alkhalil's previous internship was in France and was required for high school graduation (00:05:48).
Involvement and Networking Challenges Amal Alkhalil stated that they have joined the robotics club and the wind turbine energy club at Iowa State but admitted to being very introverted and shy, which makes them struggle with socializing and networking, including at career fairs (00:05:48). Mansour Manci empathized with Amal Alkhalil, sharing their own similar struggles with shyness at career fairs. Mansour Manci suggested that involvement in activities Amal Alkhalil is passionate about, such as Islamic topics, can help bridge the gap in socializing (00:07:49).
Internship Focus and Project Ideas Amal Alkhalil mentioned being interested in a prosthetics company in Austin, Texas, as a specific area for internships. Mansour Manci advised Amal Alkhalil that homework includes identifying specific industries and companies of interest for applications, as passion comes through in face-to-face interactions (00:09:25). Amal Alkhalil shared that a previous software engineering class, SE 185, involving creative projects like creating games, was a favorite (00:10:20). Mansour Manci suggested that independent projects, which Amal Alkhalil could complete within a month, might bolster their resume and interview content if they lack experience (00:18:46).
Academic and Experience Gaps Mansour Manci summarized that Amal Alkhalil's biggest concerns likely include not having past internships and a lack of leadership experience (00:11:26). Amal Alkhalil suggested that creating a youth engineering club with their sister could address the lack of leadership experience. Amal Alkhalil's GPA is 3.4, which Mansour Manci considered "pretty good" and above the typical minimum cutoff for most companies (00:12:16).
The Coaching Program Structure and Feedback Mansour Manci introduced the three-session coaching program designed to help individuals secure their first engineering job or internship, emphasizing that Amal Alkhalil's participation is free in exchange for feedback (00:14:04). Mansour Manci requested detailed, constructive feedback on what was useful or not useful in the program to refine the roadmap (00:15:03). Mansour Manci also requested a testimonial or success story if Amal Alkhalil finds the program valuable (00:15:43).
Session Breakdown and Timeline The program will consist of three 90-minute weekly sessions, with material and homework sent beforehand. Session one will focus on resume transformation, optimizing bullet points, and mindset preparation, which is timely for the Iowa State career fair around February 8th or 10th (00:16:30). Session two will cover interview strategy, focusing on extracting strong interview examples from current experience and potentially recommending independent projects (00:17:54). Session three will be a live mock behavioral interview with detailed feedback on how to improve answers (00:18:46).
Program Resources and Next Steps Mansour Manci noted that all covered material and session recordings will be accessible to Amal Alkhalil (00:17:16).
