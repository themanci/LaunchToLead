Mansour Manci: Hello. Hello.
Amal Alkhalil: Hi Salam.
Mansour Manci: How's good?
Amal Alkhalil: How are you doing?
Mansour Manci: Alhamdulillah. How are you?
Amal Alkhalil: Good, thank you.
Mansour Manci: How is uh how's your break going so far?
Amal Alkhalil: Good. Not too bad.
Mansour Manci: You guys go back uh what? Next week. You have this week off, the whole
Amal Alkhalil: Oh, no.
Mansour Manci: week.
Amal Alkhalil: We go um we go the 20 the the the week of the 20th. So I forgot which day exactly, but yeah, we have one month for interview.
Mansour Manci: Oh, you got a long time off. Okay. Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Okay. Cool. That's good. Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: Um, so I uh I I took a look at your your um LinkedIn a little bit. Um uh I didn't see uh any any resume or anything, but so you are right now you're in your sophomore year.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Is that
Amal Alkhalil: Um, no.
 
 
00:03:05
 
Amal Alkhalil: Oh,
Mansour Manci: right?
Amal Alkhalil: I need to update that part. I I forget to update it, but no. Um, so this is my actually my fourth year, but I was still behind because I had to take like um a lot of classes that I used to take in high school, but you know, so I started very um things. So I was supposed to graduate in um December 2026,
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Amal Alkhalil: the fall 2026, but um I changed my major, so it added me like one one more semester now. So yeah,
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: my graduation date is um of spring 2027.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: Uh let me I'm taking notes here too as we talk. So spring 2027 graduation and what so what did you change your major from?
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: What to what?
Amal Alkhalil: Um so I was software so I was first undecided then I became a software engineer then I became electrical
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: engineer.
Mansour Manci: Now you're electrical.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
 
 
00:04:03
 
Mansour Manci: And why did you change to electrical?
Amal Alkhalil: and I just um because I guess uh I didn't really like software that much and um so I wanted to do because I changed just last semester my major I wanted to do biomeical engineering because I software engineering I
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: I don't really like it that much and yeah so and I guess I talked to people and they were like biomedical engineering is too niche or you need to do something more broad something that you can find like a lot more jobs in it. So,
Mansour Manci: Mhm.
Amal Alkhalil: um I guess I turned electrical engineering cuz I can still um take a lot of classes that are like biomedical based, you know, like bio sensors and all that.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Amal Alkhalil: So, I was like, why not?
Mansour Manci: Okay. And you you wanted to pick like the hardest major possible to challenge yourself as
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: well.
Amal Alkhalil: Oh, yeah. A lot more math and physics.
Mansour Manci: Oh my gosh, we had to take a couple electrical engineering classes in mechanical and those those were people complain about thermal,
 
 
00:05:01
 
Amal Alkhalil: Huh?
Mansour Manci: people complained about heat transfer. That double E class that there were just two classes we had to take. The first one was like, okay, it was like,
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: yeah, I can figure it out. I don't like this very much.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: The second one, if I didn't have there's a TA that I had who helped me with some stuff, like if I didn't have that guy,
Amal Alkhalil: Uhhuh.
Mansour Manci: no chance. Zero chance. you know, it just gets so abstract. You know, I think in mechanical engineering,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: there's always a way you can imagine stuff, right?
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: In electrical engineering, even the professor was like, "Listen, the harder you're going to try to imagine this,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: the worse you're going to understand it. So, just don't even try." I was like, "Okay, it's a good thing I'm not alone right now." So, okay. So, you're planning to graduate in spring 2027, inshallah.
 
 
00:05:48
 
Mansour Manci: So,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: that gives you one more internship or one internship this summer.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep. Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Have you done any internships
Amal Alkhalil: Um, no. So I the only internship I did was like when I was back in high school cuz you know um French schools they require you to do
Mansour Manci: yet?
Amal Alkhalil: an internship to graduate. So that was the only one I did and I didn't have any internship in college.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: And was that the one you did in high school? Was that in Ner or that was in France?
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: Okay. What kind of uh like clubs or like onampus involvement stuff do you have at Iowa
Amal Alkhalil: Um I last semester um I joined the robotics club and
Mansour Manci: State?
Amal Alkhalil: the um wind turbine energy um club. Um, I honestly clubs I just join and then go to a couple of meetings. But I feel like you need to be uh you need to say more like you need to be really really involved to be able to have like a um like a role in the club and stuff like that.
 
 
00:06:58
 
Amal Alkhalil: And but I feel like that's my problem. I'm really really really really bad at um socializing, networking, all that.
Mansour Manci: So, no leadership position,
Amal Alkhalil: It's Yep.
Mansour Manci: just you had joined a couple clubs and attended some things. Okay. Do you think the the the the lack of networking and socializing is it is it just from being
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: like generally socially shy or are you normally extroverted? You just don't really enjoy networking. like what would you say is like the main crutch is the main issue.
Amal Alkhalil: Um really introverted and shy and all that. Yeah. Yep. I try,
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: but I feel like even when I try because um uh you know when I go to the um career fairs and all that, I feel like I don't even sound confident enough to get you right. Like I don't know. It's just so hard for me to do that.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Amal Alkhalil: So yeah,
Mansour Manci: One one of the best things I think like in general is to be typically so I'll tell
 
 
00:07:49
 
Amal Alkhalil: it's
Mansour Manci: you about myself at least right I was very introverted I was very very very shy all from middle elementary school middle school high school even college like the first few times I went to the career fair oh my gosh it was like overwhelming you know I just I think my first one of my first engineering classes I was a freshman I had no like hopes of getting an internship but it was like you need to go and talk to like 10 recruiters or something as
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: like an assign time it, you know, I was like sweating bullets,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: you know, it was like, you know, so I've been there. I I I know what it feels like. I would say also for the clubs and stuff, if you're it helps to bridge that gap to be involved in something you're passionate about, right? I noticed for myself like if I want to get social about something I'm not passionate about,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: it's even harder to get right social. If it's something that you enjoy,
 
 
00:08:43
 
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: you at least you have the benefit of like I like this thing. It's not like I'm forcing myself to be social about something I don't care about.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: You know what I mean?
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: So that that that helped me a lot when I first started Iowa State.
Amal Alkhalil: That's Mhm.
Mansour Manci: I started giving in the masjid, you know? So I was passionate about Islamic topics,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: giving. So it was it helps because you reframe in your mind like,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: okay, I want to do this thing, but I have this roadblock to get there. I'm passionate about this thing and I have to network with people to accomplish my goal. But if the goal itself you don't care about it, it becomes very hard to force yourself to become social.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Right? So that's like a little uh a piece of advice and I think we can focus on that too a little bit in the sessions as as we go through through this program a little bit inshallah.
 
 
00:09:25
 
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: So um okay do you have any like specific
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: companies or any specific areas that you're interested in for internships that you kind of have like your dream list of companies or types of roles anything like that that you've started working on?
Amal Alkhalil: Um, yes. I when I went to um Austin I I um saw a company u let me f*** I don't have the name in my head but um it was like a prosthetics they do like prosthetics and all that and they're based in Austin, Texas. So that was really nice.
Mansour Manci: Okay,
Amal Alkhalil: And um let me
Mansour Manci: that's okay. We don't need the name as long as you I just really want you to be thinking about like what area you're interested in,
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: what companies because uh you know applying to something you're interested in, doing some research about them, it's something you're passionate about, it comes through in your uh especially at the career fair if you if you get to talk face to face.
 
 
00:10:20
 
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: So really the homework is kind of just to be be thinking about what industries, what companies, what am I interested in,
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: you know what I mean?
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Not just hoping for any internship with anybody, right?
Amal Alkhalil: And Yeah.
Mansour Manci: that puts you in a in a very broad uh pool of candidates.
Amal Alkhalil: That's true.
Mansour Manci: So, okay. Um,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: any favorite classes specifically that stand out to you that that you really enjoyed so far in your
Amal Alkhalil: Um
Mansour Manci: curriculum
Amal Alkhalil: uh no no uh any classes I really enjoyed um and let's say in the first class I took for software engineering I think was SE 185 was really like a simple class and we did like
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: projects like um creating games stuff like that and so it was really fun fun class not too heavy on coding So,
Mansour Manci: Not too ind depth coding.
Amal Alkhalil: it was really fun.
Mansour Manci: Okay. So, was the creative aspect of it that was interesting for you?
 
 
00:11:26
 
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah. Yep.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: And also, I'm planning on taking a um um uh uh what is it called? Um biomedical some biomedical classes for my last year. So, I'm really excited for those. They're like bio sensors and all that. So, I I really like those kind of stuff.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: You're going to take them like as electives,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: you mean?
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah. As elective.
Mansour Manci: Okay, that's good. Yeah,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: that'll complement your what your initial passion and goal was about. Anyway,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: that's good. Okay. Um, I think right now,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: usually I ask if any gaps on your resume you're concerned about. If I was to guess, I would say with where you are, probably your biggest concern is just not having an internship in the in the past,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep. Yeah.
Mansour Manci: maybe lack of like leadership
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
 
 
00:12:16
 
Amal Alkhalil: So for that too,
Mansour Manci: experience.
Amal Alkhalil: I was thinking um about maybe with my sister if you can create like a just like a um youth club in Inkeny um for kids just you know
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Amal Alkhalil: to get to know engineering and stuff like that. I feel like it would be really great.
Mansour Manci: I saw on your uh LinkedIn too that you helped I know your mom she started uh or or you and your mom
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: just like a or some kind of sentence.
Amal Alkhalil: The zoo sent Yeah.
Mansour Manci: How involved were you with
Amal Alkhalil: H um well I help here and there um I help
Mansour Manci: that?
Amal Alkhalil: with the logo um creating the logo um with my sister and stuff like that. So
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: yeah.
Mansour Manci: Um, GPA, is there any concerns with GPA or is it is it pretty
Amal Alkhalil: Um yeah,
Mansour Manci: high.
Amal Alkhalil: good enough. I think I'm 3.4 for something.
Mansour Manci: What?
Amal Alkhalil: So
Mansour Manci: Okay.
 
 
00:13:16
 
Mansour Manci: So, it's it's pretty good right now, but not a lot of room to go down.
Amal Alkhalil: yeah.
Mansour Manci: So, we want to I mean,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: my undergraduate GPA was not fantastic. Uh, so I went to graduate school and I helped kind of erase that because then I could use my graduate GPA.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: But my opinion is as long as you're above the cutoff of most companies,
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: GPA is not really going to like be a huge be a huge huge factor.
Amal Alkhalil: hit me.
Mansour Manci: I think I mean it's always circumstantial. It depends or some companies,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: some recruiters like they worship GPA. To me,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: I wouldn't even want to work at somewhere that thinks like that anyways. But as long as you have the minimum, I think then the rest of your story is what is what sells you.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: It's not like the GPA itself. So as long as you're above the minimum, which most places I think now they're like 2.8 2.9 is like the min.
 
 
00:14:04
 
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mansour Manci: So you should be good. Okay. Um so a little bit about the program overall. So maybe I should talk a little bit about what I'm doing here. So my goal is to offer uh a coaching program for
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: people to help at least right now the the the market or the niche is people trying to get their first engineering job.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Um I know right now we're looking at internship but you know if this if everything goes well and you find it valuable
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: I'll still be around inshallah when you graduate and can help you again if you if you need some help of course. Um, but let me let me share my screen and I I'll just kind of show you a little bit of a general um kind of layout of what I have in mind. Um, okay. So, and it's important for me to mention now too that um,
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: of course I'm I'm doing this right doing this and you're you're you'll be maybe there's three people right now including you who are kind of going through at the same time.
 
 
00:15:03
 
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: My goal really is to help you as much as I possibly can with these three sessions. And in return,
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: I'm asking for the main thing I really am after is feedback. So like going through the three sessions,
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: I want like, you know, if if you just say it sucked, that's not very helpful.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: And and if you say if you say it was good,
Amal Alkhalil: Constructive.
Mansour Manci: that's not helpful. I I kind of want after we finish the program to sit like, okay, what was useful? What was not useful?
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: Even like this first call, you know, if you think back and you say what could have been more useful to talk about,
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: you know, etc., etc. I'm really looking for I have an idea. I've laid out kind of the entire road map for the program.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: I want people to go through it to tell me what was useful,
 
 
00:15:43
 
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: what was not useful, how could I tweak it, make it better, make it more, you know, value added for the person going through it.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: So that's the main thing that I would like from people going through it for free like you.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah. Uh-huh.
Mansour Manci: And the second piece, and I say this really sincerely, only if you found it valuable to get like a a testimonial or a success story so that I can hopefully spread and advertise a little bit better.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: So, so keep that in mind. You know, anything I go through, if you have a to jot down a note or something, if you think, man, that doesn't make sense. This could be better. I think he should have focused on this. You know, we're going to I'm so open to feedback.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: You have no idea how much I'm looking for feedback. So don't feel bad or feel like shy or you have to like act like it's good if it's not.
 
 
00:16:30
 
Mansour Manci: So right now this is what I have laid out.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep. Uhhuh.
Mansour Manci: So my goal is to do once a week. I think once a week is good because leaving too big of a gap drags things on too
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: much.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: More than once a week is I think too aggressive.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Um so there will be after our session today I'll send you a bunch of material.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: There'll be some stuff to review.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm. Okay.
Mansour Manci: um a couple of things that are kind of like homework items to get prepared for the first actual session. Then we'll have the first 90 minute session and the the main focus of the first 90-minute session will be to
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: dig into your resume. Make sure that your resume is really really really strong. So we're going to do that by not only um ramp amping up your
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: bullet points um I'm going to give you a bunch of other advice about mindset.
 
 
00:17:16
 
Mansour Manci: Uh and I think this will be very very useful too for I think the career fair in Iowa State is February 8th or 10th
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: or something like that.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: So inshallah we're hitting really good timing with this as well where that should boost you up for that.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah. Okay.
Mansour Manci: So this is first session is all about resume transformation a lot of like conceptual how we going to
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: actually do it and some guidelines on what you can do to make your resume good.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: Then there'll be you know a bunch of a bunch of this everything we cover by the way too will be accessible to you. So, I'll email you PDFs.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: You'll have all this information for your records later to come back and refer to.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: And even these sessions, they'll be recorded, so you can come back and see the recording if you want to at any point.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay,
Mansour Manci: And you'll get the transcript.
 
 
00:17:54
 
Amal Alkhalil: that's very
Mansour Manci: Um, so then there'll be some more homework and things before session two.
Amal Alkhalil: nice.
Mansour Manci: Session two, the main focus will be the interview strategy. And we're really going to spend a lot of time on trying to pull out your trying to pull out some really really good resume points and some interview examples from your current experience.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm. Okay.
Mansour Manci: So I think your situation is very common so far what I've been posting on social media and Tik Tok. I get a lot of DMs from people saying I don't have internship experience. I don't have leadership experience in a club. Like what can I do to bolster my resume and do good in the interview?
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: So session two is going to be all about that. So I think there's um sometimes people sell themselves short and they don't think they have
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: content good in their experience and I'll help you try to extract that inshallah.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: The other piece is I have some ideas for if you really truly have nothing and we don't find a lot in
 
 
00:18:46
 
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: that in that vault.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: I think there's within a month a couple projects I can suggest that you can just do by yourself
Amal Alkhalil: Uhhuh.
Mansour Manci: that'll be a good selling point for you to have on your resume and during interviews and you can you could do them like independent of a class, independent of anything.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm. Yeah.
Mansour Manci: So that can bolster things a lot as well.
Amal Alkhalil: Very good.
Mansour Manci: After session two,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: there'll be some more notes and some things I'll send to you.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: Then before session three, there'll be a little bit of homework, but the main focus of session three will be an actual live mock interview. So most of that time will spend doing an actual behavioral-based interview and I
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: will after each question you answer or at the end of all the questions. I haven't exactly decided yet, but I'll give you very very very very specific detailed feedback how you can make that answer better.
 
 
00:19:30
 
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: What kind of follow-up questions that I would typically have like as a John Deere manager interviewing you, how you can make it better. just basically like excruciating detail about we might only have time to like pick apart two of your answers, but you'll get the idea of like what you need to add to make it a fivestar example.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: And that will conclude the the third session. Uh a bunch of bonus material kind of about job hunting and negotiating offers and stuff after
Amal Alkhalil: Come on.
Mansour Manci: that. Um and that's the main three sessions, 90 minutes each. Um, and then the last part of the package that I'm kind of offering to everybody is that school.com uh community that I sent you to.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: So, we've only got 12 13 people there now,
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: but I'm posting more and more content there. And I think one of the things I'll add to the program is if you go through the program right now, school.com, it's free, so anyone can join.
 
 
00:20:25
 
Mansour Manci: Eventually,
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: that will be there'll be a cost attached to that,
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: but I'll say you have three months after you finish this program to join for free. So, you can ask me any questions you want. So, let's say you get an interview, you're not really sure, career fair is coming up, and as that community grows, there's more people there. So,
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: like if you're looking for a mock interview partner, or if you're you're you want to add something to your resume, you can like post it to the whole community. And it's it's a the idea is like it's better than just posting to LinkedIn or Facebook.
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: It's like a committed people who are actually serious about the same goals you have as far as
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: career. So, everybody can help each other and I'm there monitoring the content, too, and can weigh in and help, and you can direct message me as well. So that's kind of the package and the the goal inshallah um what I have envisioned and laid out.
 
 
00:21:10
 
Mansour Manci: Um any questions from your end or any
Amal Alkhalil: Um, no.
Mansour Manci: comments?
Amal Alkhalil: I think that's a really good layout, honestly. Like, it's really good structured. So,
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Amal Alkhalil: I'm excited.
Mansour Manci: As far as starting um I would like to at least like give one week so that you have time to review the stuff I'm going to send you. We don't we want to make it like realistic as what it's going to be for a real person.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: So I think sometime the week of the 5th.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: Do you have a a day specifically that works really
Amal Alkhalil: Um the week of the fifth like we can do um we can do every Monday
Mansour Manci: well?
Amal Alkhalil: if that's that works with you.
Mansour Manci: Okay. So we can do uh the fifth we can start at six o'clock at the same time we met here. Okay. Let me write this down.
Amal Alkhalil: Yep.
Mansour Manci: Okay. Then I'll just schedule them out every Monday at 6 after that for for two more
 
 
00:22:13
 
Amal Alkhalil: Okay. Yep.
Mansour Manci: Mondays.
Amal Alkhalil: Okay, that one's good.
Mansour Manci: Okay. Let me see if I have anything else in my notes. Okay. And um yeah, the last piece again like I said looking for the feedback but also the preession things the homework is not super intensive but I think it would be really really beneficial for you
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: especially if what I send you try your best to get it done beforehand because otherwise we'll spend more time
Amal Alkhalil: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: in the session doing the homework we should have done before and it's going to be less effective.
Amal Alkhalil: Mhm.
Mansour Manci: So I have a special interest in you succeeding because I know you and I know
Amal Alkhalil: Okay.
Mansour Manci: Kabota. you don't I want to see you get an internship and succeed. But in general for anybody going through it, uh if you take it seriously and you do the the things ahead of time, I feel pretty confident that I'll be able to help you inshallah to land a good internship.
Amal Alkhalil: Me,
Mansour Manci: So,
Amal Alkhalil: too.
Mansour Manci: okay, nice talking to you. If you have any questions, you can email me, uh message me in the school community if you want to. When you have some time, if you can too, just post like a response in the introductions page. Put your basic intro, who you are, what you're looking for.
