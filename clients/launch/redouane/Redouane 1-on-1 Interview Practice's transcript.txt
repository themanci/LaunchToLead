00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Hmm…

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You hear me? So, Michael?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Redouane: Is on, okay. Yeah, there you go.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Hey, what's up, man?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Redouane: Salaam alaikum Habibi.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Alaikum salam, how are you?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Redouane: Good, good, alhamdulillah.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Redouane: Um… uh, do I need to keep the camera on? I had to…

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Redouane: Deal with my son, just put him…

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Redouane: To a position where he can leave me alone. When you have only one baby, the only person they know is you, and they're all, you know.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Redouane: They get attached so much that, uh, it's hard to say, leave me alone.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah. I think it's better if you keep it on so it's a little more realistic, but if your kid runs in the back or something, it's like, it's not a big deal. I mean, it's not any reason for us to stop or anything, so…

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Redouane: For an hour, yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But it, it help you feel like it's, you're, you're really, you know, trying to practice like real. If the camera's off, it's kind of.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Redouane: Right, are you able to… oh, you're on there.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Redouane: You're on there, no, okay, good, good. I haven't done this for a while, that's why I want to talk to you and at least get a feel of it, because I'm Rusty, you know?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Redouane: And, uh, engineering, uh, requires a little bit of, uh…

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Redouane: Professionalism, and uh…

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Redouane: Uh, you know, using the right words, you know, English is not my first language, so…

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, so, okay, for the first… like, a first thing to start, right? I mean, you've done the behavioral-based interviews before, right?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Redouane: Yeah, I did.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And you know, like, you're pretty confident with the star format, right? Situation, task, action, result.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Redouane: No.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so let's walk through that just a little bit then, okay? And…

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'm gonna… let me see here… I'm kinda new to Zoom, I switched from Google, so let me just see…

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I want to share something, but let me see.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Redouane: It's all good.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, I'm just gonna share the whole screen over there.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It will just…

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh man, why does it take the whole… oh, there it is.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, let me see if I can adjust the font…

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Is that… like, how hard is that for you to see? Is that okay, size-wise?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Redouane: Yeah, I might wanna, like, might think about, maybe…

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Redouane: Throw you on the computer instead.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Bigger.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000

Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh my god.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Redouane: Right.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Redouane: Meeting ID, uh, let me see here…

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Redouane: I'm just gonna do this…

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Redouane: Yes.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Redouane: Paste…

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Redouane: Uh, do I need to do this?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Redouane: Meeting ID…

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Redouane: I'll be…

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Redouane: Based.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Redouane: Boom. Okay. Am I joining from the computer is better?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Redouane: Um…

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000

Redouane: And the… because… because…

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Redouane: With her, it's gonna be on the computer, just…

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Redouane: See if my microphone works, and the screen is better.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Redouane: Hmm…

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Redouane: Use microphone and camera, that's fine.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Redouane: Hello?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000

Redouane: Uh, Interview Practice, yeah, that's me, one-on-one.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Redouane: Okay, can you hear me in the other… in the other one? Let's drop this one.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: What do you mean, the other one? This is… I'm in the same meeting. Oh, let me… oh, I see what you mean, I see what you mean.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Redouane: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Redouane: This meeting is being recorded.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, now you can quit the other one.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh, you quit the wrong one, I think.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Redouane: No, no, this is fine. Can you hear me?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yes.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Redouane: Perfect. Can you hear me better now, or…

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, it's a little bit louder, it's clearer.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Redouane: Louder, I mean, like, you want it lower, or is it…

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: No, no, no, it's good. Oh, now it just dropped down, now you're very quiet.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Redouane: 5. Okay.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Redouane: Okay, is it better now?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah, like that.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Redouane: Okay, good.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Redouane: Alright, brother, um…

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Redouane: I guess I can see you now much, much bigger.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Redouane: Bigger screen…

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You can't get your camera working?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Redouane: Not on this one, not on the computer, but, uh…

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Redouane: Yeah, not on the… on the computer.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Is it… I'm sorry to be direct, ma'am. I mean, is it nerves? Are you nervous about being on camera?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Redouane: No, no, it's…

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Because when you're in a… when you're in an interview, you're gonna have to get over that, you know what I mean?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Redouane: Is it… no, no, it's not… honestly, it's not… it's not about that. It's, uh…

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Redouane: The computer doesn't have a webcam, so…

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh, okay. Okay, that's fine, we'll continue without it then.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Redouane: Yeah, it's a desktop. How did you get the background? I like that.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That's real background, man, that's behind me.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Redouane: Oh, really? You play… you play… you play guitar?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I built that.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Redouane: Good, good, good. Okay, yeah, I play drums, but…

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Nice. Yeah, everyone asks me if it's AI-generated background.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Redouane: Yeah. Yeah, it looks nice.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh… yeah, thank you.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Redouane: Yeah, ma'am.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, can you see this shared thing?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Redouane: Yes, yes, I can see everything.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay. So, let's talk just a few minutes about the star Interview format, okay? You've done them, but maybe, you know, we'll go into a little bit of…

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: a little bit more detail about some key things. Now, we're not going to go too far, but… so you get the idea, right? So the idea behind the STAR Interview format.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The idea behind the behavioral interviews altogether.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: is…

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: His past performance…

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Predict future performance or behavior.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That's why everybody went to this, right? So that's why they always tell, tell me about a time you did this, tell me about a time you did that.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The idea is, like, when this first emerged, is, like, the way you behaved in the past is very likely the way you're going to behave in the future. Um…

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, the best way to answer that, which everyone kind of knows at this point now, the reason why they're called star Interviews, is.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You talk about the situation.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: for each example, then the task, the actions, and the results, right? And the situation is kind of…

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: the setup, right? Background information.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Context.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: What I like to emphasize here, too, for when I coach people and when I interview myself, is…

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, so the keys here is don't…

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: uh, gloss over this fast, okay? A lot of times, for example, like at Deer and other places, you know, an interview is, like, an hour long, right? You get into the interview.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It's usually about 5 to 10 minutes of, hello, hi, how are you, introduce yourself, I'm so-and-so, we're interviewing today, thanks for joining us, blah blah blah, 5-10 minutes.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You get 50 minutes left, usually there's gonna be, like, 5 minutes at the end, so you have about 45 minutes. Usually, like, most of the times that I've been in them, it's usually about 5 questions.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right? So you've got, what, uh… 9 minutes each question, something like that, 8-9 minutes. A lot of people, they glaze over this situation very, very, very fast, and even the task part.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right? I would say you want to spend, you know, if I have a 9-minute interview, I'm looking at… so let's… I'm just gonna say…

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: For a 9 minute… for 9…

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: On a question.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right, I want to spend…

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Maybe 2 minutes here?

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Redouane: Right.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Here, let's do this.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Maybe 2 minutes here.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And then on the task.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I probably want to spend…

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Somewhere around 2 minutes?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The results, somewhere around 2 minutes.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right? We're, like, at 6 now?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm. We're left with 4, huh?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Somewhere around 3 minutes.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Redouane: Or, uh…

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right? Something like that, right? Your actions should probably be a little bit longer than the rest, right? If we want to say.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Redouane: I am.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, 1 to 2, 1 to 2, 1 to 2, 3 to 4, but the point is, most people spend, like.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: 10 seconds on the situation, 20 seconds on the task? Yeah, so…

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Redouane: It's important, because, yeah, it's important.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Setting up the background, setting up the context, like, one of the most difficult things that most engineers.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Have is understanding, like, okay, you know the example really well in your head. This other person sitting across from you.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Redouane: convenient. Right. Right.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: doesn't know anything about it. It's from zero. So, don't gloss over this fast.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, and the other thing is…

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Paint the pain. So…

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Redouane: Emphasize what was really needed at the time, or what was the issue, and how, yeah.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah. Yeah.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I came up with this kind of stupid phrase, right? But the bigger the dragon you slay, the bigger the hero you are. A lot of people set it up where it's, like, not that impressive, so when you deliver, people are like, ah, cool, whatever, it doesn't sound that impressive, right?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Redouane: Yes.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm. You said something else that was interesting, but I… you know, keep going.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So you really…

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay. Um…

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, like, you know, and how do you paint the pain? It's like, okay, what's the time constraint we were up against?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: was it, like, a new technology, something I had to learn in a very short period of time, or something just very challenging in general? Did it… did it have an impact in terms of… a big impact in terms of dollar amount for the company?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: What's… make mistakes high so that people are engaged and they're listening now, they're like, okay, I want to hear how we solved this and how we did this. Then when you deliver your actions and your results.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Redouane: Oh.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: it's like, okay, wow, that's impressive, right? So, you really want to spend the right time giving the context.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Redouane: Right.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Who was involved, who are the key players, and the key with all these is you, right? Me.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Redouane: Hold on, yeah.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Redouane: Yep.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: What was the situation, task, actionable results of you, not we, right? If you're using the word we, you're doing this wrong.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, the next one is the task. So, like, okay, what were you specifically…

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Supposed to do…

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Or challenged with, right? So this is laying out, okay, this is the situation we were in, but the task I was in charge of, or what I had to do.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: what did you have to do, specifically you, even if it was a group project, even if it was a team effort, which most engineering things are.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Redouane: Uh-huh.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But what was your part of that group effort, right? What was your part of that team project?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Redouane: I guess part of the big, bigger dragon analogy is to bring we first, to make it.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Redouane: Oh, the whole team will be losing, or the, you know, everybody was this, and, you know, to…

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, that's fine. The whole department's gonna be this, the whole entire production factory's gonna be shut down, yeah.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Redouane: Right.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Redouane: Uh, yeah, but…

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Redouane: And then you… you zoom in and… yeah.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The task, you come with you. Yeah. Okay. Then the actions… there's a couple key things to mention here for the actions.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um… maybe… so this is a little bit…

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Easier just to follow along.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Because I'm going to have a couple of bullets for the actions that I think are important. So…

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: We want to have…

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: a…

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, okay, we want to…

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: talk about…

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, I'm gonna not use the word we, it's confusing. So, talk about the actions.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You took.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: specifically you. What actions did you take? Don't say, we did this, and we decided that, and then we did this.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Redouane: I see that.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: What did you do? I did this, then I did that, then I did that. The other thing that people struggle with is, like.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Walk through…

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: the actions…

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Sequentially.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, when you write out your examples, you start thinking about your examples in more detail, like, imagine that you have to write out the actions you took.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: and number them, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and one comes before 2, 2 comes before 3. Because a lot of people will get into an interview and they'll go.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Redouane: Yep.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, I had to, you know, this was the situation, this was the task, and they start talking about actions, and they say, well, I did this thing.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, also, oh yeah, I did this, and then also, oh, I had to go and do that, and it's hard to…

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Redouane: You lose points there when you're starting.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, when you're the interviewer, you're like, hey, tell it to me like a story, like, tell it to me as if.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Redouane: Right.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: In time, what happened first, then second, then third, then fourth?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Redouane: Just… just natural, yeah.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, and then if you can, the more you practice, you can, you can, like, um…

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: preview how many actions you took. This is really powerful, this is kind of an advanced.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Redouane: Yeah, the advanced speakers are, like, the best speakers that…

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Redouane: Uh, that really, uh, wins this wins your, your, your attention is when they say, 1, I did this second, like, you know, that kind of thing.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, not just that, but before they start, they say, okay, there's 6 key things that I did to accomplish this.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Redouane: Right.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So what that does, before you even start, the interviewer, in his mind, especially if I'm taking notes, which you always are as the interviewer.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Redouane: You're waiting for it, yeah.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'm already writing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, right? I know. So when he gets to number 4.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Redouane: Alright.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I know there's only 2 more. If I don't say, I got 6 things, and I just start listing them off.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: After number 4, sometimes the interview, you're, like, checked out, you're like, man, what is this guy? 10 things? 15 things?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, that's a very advanced one, but you have to know your examples very, very well to…

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right?

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so talk about the actions you took, walk through them sequentially.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, okay, that's kind of the main thing there. High level for actions.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And then results. This is very important, too. This is similar to situation task. Most engineers glaze over this fast, or…

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Don't be generic.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Redouane: Yeah, yeah, give figures, or numbers, or…

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Most…

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, most people say it went well.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It was good.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I got good feedback.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It was a success, right? All these are terrible ways to end your energy example, right? So you want to include.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: try to include metrics, like, what does good mean? What does successful mean? What does well mean? Yeah, percentage…

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Redouane: Percentage, or…

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Redouane: Or more money down, yeah.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: A dollar amount, whatever, time saved.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Redouane: Right.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, um…

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So that's your result, and again, um, the wider you can show the results.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right? You want to show…

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Show wide impact.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: As far as you can.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so this is the traditional STAR method they teach. Situation, task, actions, results.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I teach two additional things on top of this.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The biggest lesson learned?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And…

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Go back in time. And the reason I start teaching these, and I use them myself, is because I've sat in a lot of interviews. One of the most common, the most common two follow-up questions I've ever heard in 8 years.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: is… okay…

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: What's your biggest lesson learned from this example? What's the biggest takeaway, right? That can come in the form of.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, what's the biggest lesson learned? What's your biggest takeaway?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: you know, biggest new thing you've found out, whatever, right? It means…

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: What's your biggest…

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The biggest lesson you took away from this thing.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, I coach, like, just say this before they ask it. Give it as part of your answer. Like, do the star.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And then at the very end, you could just say, the biggest lesson learned, the biggest takeaway I had from this experience was blah blah blah blah.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, and the point of lessons… the lesson learned is, uh… so…

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The point here is to show you're a person who thinks.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Retrospectively, right? You don't just do stuff, and then go on and do other stuff.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: you do stuff, and you sit and you think and go, wow, how did that go? What went well? Okay, I want to do more of what…

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Redouane: You learn. You build up.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah. And the go-back-in-time question, so… and then you can also add to it, depending on time, you can say.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And if I can go back in time and do it over again, that's the second most common question. If you can go back in time, what would you do different?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, the point of this question… the point of you answering this preemptively is to show that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You think about process improvement.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So not just you… they're kind of similar, but they're a little bit different, right? The lesson learned is I think I have a retrospective, I think what went well, what didn't go well.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The, the, if I can go back in time as you literally think, okay, if I can go back and repeat this thing again.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That's process improvement, right? Because your lesson learned might be, you know, a high-level lesson that you could apply anywhere. This is showing.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, I already thought to myself, yeah, if I can go back and now redo this project, I probably would have wrote the script in Python, not in.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh, and see, because blah blah blah blah, whatever, right?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, to me, these are… these are the core elements of your answer for a behavioral-based interview question. The more you can master these, practice them.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Document them for all your examples, memorize your examples in this framework. You're just going to do better and better and better and better.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Redouane: Yeah, and… and I feel like when… when you come prepared like this, you get less, um…

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Redouane: They're… they're… they're gonna let you go fast, and they'd be happy, and you're most likely to…

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Redouane: You know, sometimes you're not showing them enough, and they keep asking you all kind of questions, and…

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Redouane: It leads to, like, it's good to be prepared, and this is a nice roadmap.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, and you don't want to be in a situation where they're, like, kind of, like, you know, they're pulling teeth, they have to keep asking you, okay, so, like, what are the tasks? Okay, so, like, what was the results? Okay, so, like.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Redouane: Hmm. Hmm.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, that gets annoying as an interviewer, too. You feel like, man, you actually end up docking people points because it's like, hey.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Redouane: Alright.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I had to, like, pull it out of him, you know? He didn't even answer himself.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Redouane: Alright. Well…

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, um…

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That's the basic structure. Now, one more thing I'll mention, then we can jump into a couple questions and practice a little bit. The other thing I… that I teach, and I believe, and I've kind of.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: From being on the interviewer side of the table, interviewing people, having to rank them.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, we typically, like, within DEAR, our ranking system is.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: 1 to 5 stars.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so… now, this is not, like, star, this kind of star, this is just, like…

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Redouane: Yeah, this metric, this way to rate people.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, like, yeah, yeah. So, 1 to 5 star, so…

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And I'll tell you kind of… interviewing too, right, it's kind of… it's part art, part science, right? Not everything is like…

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Even when people rate, grade your interview and how they assess you as a person they interviewed, it's not a, it's not a science, right? You can't get out a.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Redouane: Right.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Redouane: Right, right. There is… there is, like, about 30-40% of how they like you, and whether they have something in common, and your energy, and all that.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: instrument and measure. It's subjective, a little bit.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Opinion and.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah. So, one star, like, I give this kind of framework quickly, one star is like, you know.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I don't know. I don't want to be too harsh, you should probably kill yourself, but one star is, like, you showed up with, like, you know, vomit on your shirt.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Redouane: Bad dog.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Redouane: One storage bags.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, horrible, you know, very bad, right?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Redouane: Bed, bed bugs.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Like, you showed up maybe late, 15 minutes, you know, just, like, absolute train wreck from right?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Redouane: Yeah, today, just like today.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Redouane: Oh…

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Two is…

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, 2 is, like…

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Redouane: He tried.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You didn't answer the competency?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And probably… not even the question. And we can get to that, too. There's a difference between answering the question and the competency. They're not always exactly the same thing.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Number 3 is…

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: acceptable, right? This is…

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Minimum to pass the interview.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: At least that deer we had, this is… if anybody scored a 2-star or less on any question in the whole interview.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: They're thrown out, they cannot be considered for an offer, right? So 3 is like, you answered the question.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You answered the competency.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But, nothing impressive.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It's like, you wouldn't go tell other people, recruiters, like.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Redouane: Yeah, you… you won't remember any… anything, nothing…

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, like, you checked the box, you did the bare minimum.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: 4 is now where it starts to get interesting. 4 is…

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You… you did 3 plus…

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Above and beyond. So, you went above and beyond… so, not just in your delivery of the answer, the example itself. Like, I'm talking about how we're rating the content of the examples, not…

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Redouane: Uh-huh.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: not just the person's appearance, and how they delivered, and if they spoke clearly. I'm saying the content of the example they're giving.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Redouane: Person… person's appearance?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Redouane: Is it a thing?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, I think that matters a lot.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Redouane: Oh, really?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: If you show up with your hair everywhere, and you got, like, things in your eyes from the morning, and you, you know, your shirt has stains on it, like, it just.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Redouane: Oh, man.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: People perceive all of that.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Redouane: Oh, wow.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, part of the reason, like, why did I go invest money in a background like this, right? Like, do I think this background is gonna…

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Change the effectiveness of the content I'm coaching? No. But when I open my camera right away.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Redouane: No.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And I, like, even right now, I wouldn't be sitting with a, with a t-shirt in front of a real client, right? Because we're friends, I know you, it's not a big deal.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Redouane: Right.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Redouane: And.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I would be in a button-up shirt, but once I open the camera, and it's HD, it's a very high-quality camera with autofocus.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Redouane: Right.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I have lighting, I have lights here, here, here, here, I have a background. When someone comes into this meeting, they feel like.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh this guy is serious.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Redouane: Yeah, yeah, I agree.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Right? So, appearance is everything. When you turn your camera on in an interview.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: If you don't have a decent background, get on your kitchen table and just have a white wall behind you, right? You don't want to be, like, in your bedroom where your bed is behind you, where the bed is not made, pillows are hanging off.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You wanna… people…

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Redouane: Well, what you just saw today, is it okay?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Redouane: Oh…

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I didn't really see your background much, it looked like the camera was down and up, so I don't think I saw the bed or any furniture behind you.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Redouane: No, I'm in a…

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But the way you were dressed was good, you were a white dressy shirt, and you looked like you were shaved and.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Redouane: Pretty sure, yeah.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Redouane: Yeah, I did shave, because I thought, you know, we're gonna meet up, like, might as well shave, you know, my face.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, I mean, you looked presentable. I would just try to get… make sure you're in a well-lit room, if it's during the day.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Redouane: Okay.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Redouane: Hmm. Open the window, yeah.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Make sure that you're… you're facing the window, don't have the window behind you, because it'll make it hard.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Redouane: Yeah, I have it, I have it on… exactly on the right spot.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah. Yeah, just make sure behind you there isn't, like, you know, it's not cluttered or, you know, messy or whatever, right? It just comes off as… doesn't look very good.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Redouane: Right.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, 4-star is… you check the box like the 3-star, but you went above and beyond. How do you go above and beyond in terms of the actual interview example, the content is…

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You, you know, you, um, overcame.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Huge difficulty.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You improve the process along the way.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You… you know, did it in…

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Record time…

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, you're doing something, right? It's not just…

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You're doing more than you were asked to do.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Redouane: No.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Or you had to overcome something very difficult, that's above average difficulty. If your example is, like, my manager asked me to do this, it's a pretty mundane thing, I did it.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, that's 3-star, right? Nobody's gonna be, like, impressed that you… it's like somebody who works at McDonald's that I got an order for a Big Mac, and I made it and give it to the customer. You're like, okay, cool, isn't that what you're supposed to do, right?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But if they say, oh, we got slammed before the Super Bowl, we had, like, 500 people in the store, normally the most we serve is 100, so I called in two other people, we opened a second line, we had people, like, converted a whole area in the kitchen to make burgers that normally is not even made for making burgers.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And we're pre-making stuff, just anticipating how busy we're gonna… you'd be like, oh, that's, like, out of the ordinary, right? Above and beyond.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Redouane: Alright.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, that's above, that's the 4 star. 5 star is.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Everything up to 4-star, plus…

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You spread the impact further than expected.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: or tasked with.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So this would be like, okay, you know, in the engineering context, okay, you were assigned something, it had some extreme difficulty, you improved the process maybe along the way, you did it in record time, did something amazing.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But then at the same time.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Let's say you did that for your team, then you figured out, hey, there's, like, other teams, other departments that could benefit from this thing that I did, this new tool that I made, this new process that I documented. I'm gonna go to other managers, I'm gonna share it with their group.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Or I'm gonna go in the department meeting, and I'm gonna present what I did in front of the whole entire department so that other people can adopt it. Or I'm gonna lead a training, you know, I help my team adopt this tool.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'm gonna go reach out to other managers and ask them if they want me… I'll set up a training and train 2 other teams, 20 people on this tool as well, like…

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: How did you spread your influence and your impact?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Farther than what the original.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Redouane: Task, yeah.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: assigned or expected task was, right? That's, to me, now you're at 5 star, where it's like.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: He did what was asked, he went above and beyond, he spread the impact.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: what else could you possibly ask from somebody, right? There's nothing else you can really do.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, if you get to this level.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: With all of these in place, that is like, okay.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, if you don't get the job after that, call us, either it wasn't a match, maybe your delivery wasn't great, maybe somebody else had 5 more years of experience, maybe somebody else.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: slayed even bigger dragons than you, right? But if you can accomplish all this with what you have.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Redouane: Right.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I mean, that's the best you can do, in my opinion.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Redouane: Alright.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And you can always try to push to this point, try to at least push to 4 star, sit and think, you know, what can I frame as, like, an above and beyond type of scenario? Did I do any…

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Redouane: Actually, you're talking, and I'm already thinking. The only thing, um, I was gonna ask you, uh, Mansour.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Redouane: is, for example, I do… for example, I will… so I'm trying to get a job with SEL.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Redouane: They make, like, relays, they make devices that we use heavily in control and, uh…

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Redouane: And, uh, protection for utilities. The thing is, like, when I'm trying to think about scenarios like these to answer these kind of behavioral questions.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Redouane: do I need to… it's better to find, like, a scenario where I'm using their product, or it doesn't really matter? Like, would it be more powerful?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Redouane: Uh, I mean, it would be harder to… to brainstorm it, to…

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Redouane: think about it, you know, but would it be more powerful? Like, is it worth that effort and time?

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Redouane: To… to talk…

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It would be… it would be better, I think, like, if you have 2 examples, one is with their product, one is not, and they're both the same strength.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Of course, it's better, right? But if you're gonna go down… if you're gonna go down to a 3-star example that includes their product.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Redouane: Uh-huh. So, so it's worth spending some time.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: instead of your own 5-star example that doesn't include their product, I would go with the 5-star example.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Redouane: Okay. Okay.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: and you could still add in somewhere there. I've also worked with, you know, done something similar with kind of the product that you guys deal with, but this is the one I want to share because it had some extenuating circumstances, and I think it's going to really.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It's going to demonstrate the competency a lot better, although I'm familiar with your products as well, right? But the key to these behavioral interviews is they want to understand the competency, like, are you.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Redouane: No.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: how likely are you to repeat this performance in the future, right? So…

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: If all things are equal, yeah, I would say 100% use an example that has their product in it, but if all things are not equal.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Redouane: Oh, it seems like it.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You want to use the strongest example.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Redouane: Seems like I need to step up my share, because, like, they're not paying you 100 case, and…

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Redouane: And these for, for, you know, like for no reason you, I need to step up my game in in communication and.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Redouane: I need to do more, like you just made with…

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Redouane: I feel like I, I'm glad she didn't answer me today because and then we, yeah, man.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Redouane: Yeah, I need to work on this tonight.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I mean, you could try to get involved, too, and like, um…

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I don't know for electrical engineering, but like, you know, we have, like, when I was in Waterloo, and I think, I think it's kind of an open group, it was called, um…

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Like, Toastmasters. Have you heard of Toastmasters?

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Redouane: No.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh, let me see here…

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Redouane: You keep coming up with new stuff, I don't even know. Like I said, I was… I was under a rock, and I was in the…

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Redouane: Uh, technician field where you just… you just do what you ask, and…

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Redouane: You're… you're not thinking, you know.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So I put their website in the chat here, you can save it for later if you want, but that's like a…

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: An international organization that, um…

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Helps you, like, with presentation skills. It helps you with communication skills. It's…

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Redouane: Oh.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: agnostic of engineering or anything, it's not based on a subject or a domain.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: it's just, you get a chance, and they have different chapters in different cities, like Waterloo had a chapter, I'm sure Des Moines has chapters.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: you can join and just show up there, and it's like, you just get a chance to speak in front of people. It could be, like.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Hey, next week you need to give a 3-minute speech about a vacation you went on. It doesn't even have to be anything to do with engineering.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: just to practice your communication skills, getting comfortable speaking in front of people. And then, when you go to that, if you join that club, right, they're very nice people. I participated a couple times in Waterloo.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And everyone is there to just help each other, everyone is nervous about speaking, otherwise they wouldn't be there, right? So you're not going to be out of place.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Redouane: Right.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But then you can start to say, you can pick your own topic, say, hey, I want to, I want to give a speech, like, or I want to talk next time for 5 minutes about this.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: electrical engineering project I worked on. It just gives you a chance to have an audience, you know, to give you.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Redouane: I don't have… I don't have problems speaking, uh, in front of people. I like to speak, and I'm very, very extroverted and stuff like that.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Redouane: It's the fact, like, it's a strange… it's a new world to me. It's, it's…

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, even though there, you just… you just need to get repetitions, talking about that.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Redouane: Right, right, right.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That will give you a chance to have, to have an audience that's there for you, right? I mean, it's different if you, you could talk to your wife, whoever, but it's different when it's.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Redouane: And…

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: a stranger, the stakes are higher, you have to prepare, right? And you don't look like an idiot, so you have to put time into it, and.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Redouane: Right.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Redouane: Sure, yep.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, that's a good thing to try, I think.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Redouane: Yeah, thank you.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, you're welcome. Off one. Um…

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Redouane: Chrome.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so we covered the basics of the star interview.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: We covered, kind of, the ranking, 1 to 5 stars. Anything else on your end? Questions about the interview process? Should I do this? Should I not do that? Otherwise, after we go through your questions.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: we can walk through maybe just 2 examples, even though you… I know you're not… right now you're probably thinking you're not as prepared as… with all this, don't worry about that, just…

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Like, we'll go through, you answer, and I can give you more feedback on that process, it'll help you.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But any questions before we jump into, like, an actual example?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Redouane: Um…

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Redouane: Well, the biggest question would be, um…

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Redouane: the whole process, like… like I said, engineering is new to me. Like, I've always worked as a technician, and it's always easier, and…

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Redouane: You know, the… they're…

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Mm-hmm.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Redouane: Dying for, for technicians and I get, you know, I never, like, I, I don't, I don't recall, like, failing a lot of interviews. I always do well.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Mm-hmm.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Redouane: It's just that this time, I am a little bit, um…

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Redouane: Rusty and, and new to this, like the, the way you carry out your, like, the way you speak.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Redouane: I know your English is your first language, but…

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Redouane: it's kind of amazing. Like, I want to be able to get to that level when I'm…

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Redouane: I'm… I'm speaking and conveying ideas. Like, I…

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Redouane: There is levels of communication, you know, and I want to get to that level.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Redouane: And at the same time, I guess my question is, like, what is the process of interviewing? Like, how they do engineering.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Redouane: Uh, uh…

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Redouane: Interviews, like, how does it start?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, so usually, okay, I can tell you from what I've seen from, you know, I've only seen interviews from, like, 3 different engineering places, right? But the most that I've seen was at Deer.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I mean, they're a pretty big company, so they're…

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: their process is going to be probably pretty representative of most big companies, because it's all pretty generic, right? So, you join the call, you'll get it… like, normally the first step is a phone screen, right? You probably already had phone screens, right? And the main…

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: the main point of the phone screen is to see, like, general job fit, you know? Like, if you're a electrical engineer applying for, like, a serious double-E job, and they ask you, like, some basic stuff about circuits and you don't know it, like, that's a red flag, right? So it's, like, basic knowledge, it's not a technical interview, but…

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: They want some basic domain knowledge, and they want to see a personality fit, right, because now you're applying.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Just online, they want to see, like, you know, can you communicate at all? Are you a complete hermit? Like, you know what I mean? So.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Redouane: Right.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Redouane: Right.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And then they want to see some interest in that company, which is what I coach people, like.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: talk and show enthusiasm for that company specifically, and have some specific reasons why you're interested in that company. I can't tell you how many phone screens I've done for deer, and I ask people, or, you know.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: At the career fair, like, why are you interested in deer? And they're like, well, I really need an internship this summer. You know, like, you gotta have something specific.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It feels good if you represent that company and this person's, like, interested in something specific about that company.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And…

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The last element, really, of the phone screen is, like, any big deal breakers, okay? And this is a big part.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: maybe I'll just touch on this for a minute, because this is a big part, I think, of the phone screen and of any interview that I would advise you, and a lot of people make this mistake. Don't mention any of your deal breakers until you have an offer.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, a lot of times they try to flush out, you know, like, well, you're gonna have to relocate, is that gonna be a problem for you? You're gonna have to do this, is that gonna be a problem for you?

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And, I mean, just say yes to everything and say, make it sound like it's not a big deal until you have a job offer. Once you have a job offer.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That's the place to bring up your deal breakers, because then you can negotiate based on them to get better benefits.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, like, let's say, in your mind, you say.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I would never right now accept a job if I had to relocate to…

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Florida. And this company tells you, you have to relocate to Florida for this position.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Well, if you tell them, ah, that's a big deal breaker for me, I really don't want to relocate, I just bought a house, and blah blah blah blah blah.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, like, they're already now kind of…

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: primed for you not to become a top candidate, right? Because if they're looking at the results at the end of the four people they interviewed, they'll say, well, this guy Redouane, he already said he doesn't want to come to Florida, so…

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: who else do we have here, right? But, if you're the top candidate, if they say, hey, you're gonna have to relocate to Florida, in your mind, you know you don't want to, you just say, okay, I understand that. Yeah, no, it's not a… I mean, it's not an absolute deal-breaker for me.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, I'm really interested in the role, and I'd like to go through the process so I can learn as much about the role as possible, and my number one priority is finding out, am IA good fit for the role?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: for you guys, and is your guys' company and the role and the culture a good fit for me, then we can work out any details, and I'm sure we can come to some agreement on all the details of everything.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so now…

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: you're still considered as a candidate, and now when you get… if you get an offer, you become the top candidate. If they send you an offer, you know you're their first choice.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'm the person they want to hire. So now I can come back and say, hey, listen guys, I mean, I'm not completely opposed to moving to Florida, it's just that we bought a new house 6 months ago.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: you know, what can we do here? You know, can I work remotely?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Redouane: It's not gonna backfire, though.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: No, no, because they already extended you an offer. Once they extend you an offer, you're in negotiation now.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But that's why you don't want to mention in the beginning and say, I'm completely opposed to it. You don't want to say, oh, I'm fine with that, it's no big deal, I'll move to Florida tomorrow. You know, you just want to say, oh, okay, it's not a complete deal-breaker for me. You know, I'm just… I'm very interested to learn about the role.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And when we get to that point, you know, if I'm the top candidate, we can… I'm sure we'll work out the details, we'll find a solution that makes us both happy.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, that way you don't eliminate yourself from being a top candidate. Now, once you get an offer.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: then you can come back and say, we just bought a house, you know, can we just… can you give me, like, 6 months to work remote before I have to move down there? Is there any way we can work out? Can I come.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: went down to Florida one week, every 2 months and work on site and stay here. So…

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Redouane: Is this… you never fail to shop.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Because now, once… once you…

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Once you know that you're their top candidate.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You have leverage.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Redouane: Yeah, of course.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: if you tell them at the beginning, I can't move, you didn't become the top candidate yet, you have zero leverage. They'll just say, okay, Sayonara, dude, get out of here.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So… so that's the fourth part of the phone screen, usually, is deal breakers, so don't mention any.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um… even if it's something where it's like, you gotta move to Alaska, you're like, I would die before I move to Alaska. Don't say that, because if you're the top, you don't even know the other 3 people could have showed up, like, wearing their underwear on their head, right? You could be the only serious candidate.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Redouane: And then they be like, we offer you so-and-so, and it becomes, oh, sweet, I'm leaving.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And they could…

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, and they'll say, well, double the salary to go to Alaska. You're like, I'll go to Alaska for $300,000, you know?

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Redouane: Right. Right.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Redouane: Right. I'm down. I'm down.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Sorry, if you're on a speaker, I didn't mean to cuss if your family is there, but…

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Redouane: No, no, no, no, you're good.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh, okay. Um, so yeah, that's the phone screen. Usually, when someone passes the phone screen, they start with the behavioral-based interviews, at least. There could be a technical interview before that, depending on the role.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: John Deere historically hasn't really done technical interviews. They started doing them on the software roles, because we had so many people get hired and claim they know how to code in this language and that language, and they don't know.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Redouane: Yeah.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: anything about coding. Um, but typically, it'll be probably a technical interview before a behavioral interview, I think even for EE. Um, and the technical interview.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: you know, I won't be a lot of help with that. I don't even try with my business. I can't cover every engineering discipline and train everybody on every… it'd be crazy, right? There's tons of resources out there.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: On prepping for technical interviews, you know, you've got to figure out what your niche is, what domain you want to get into.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Redouane: For sales and application, I don't think it's going to be heavily technical, but…

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, so that's a different beast, but my specialty is the behavioral, so usually at the end of that, even for hardcore Google, Microsoft tech jobs, there's always some kind of a behavioral interview.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Or they might call it a personality fit, or a culture fit, whatever. So…

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Redouane: Hmm.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That interview, when it starts, typically, you come into the meeting, thanks for joining us.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: uh, you know, hope you're having a good day, blah blah blah. Um, my name is Mansour, this is my colleague over here, Brian. Uh, we're gonna be interviewing, conducting the interview today. Um, today is gonna be a behavioral-based interview. Are you familiar with the behavioral-based interview format? You know, we advise you to answer in the STAR format.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: try to emphasize the things that you did specifically. Any questions about the behavioral-based interview style? No? Okay. Well, I'm going to introduce myself fully, my colleague will introduce himself, we'll ask you to introduce yourself.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Tell us a little bit about your background. You know, we have your resume here, we've already reviewed it, no need to go into extreme detail. If there's just any.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Redouane: Is it good to kind of, uh, when you're… when you're…

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Redouane: So, the question is, would you come up with different material or answers, or you'd rather, like, say exactly what's on… in front of them?

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: From your resume?

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Redouane: Yeah, like, is it better to…

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I, I wouldn't read anything like directly off my resume so, yeah, so once they introduce themselves, when it's your time to introduce yourself.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I can put a couple notes on here, because I'll send you these notes after.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Redouane: Thank you.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, intro…

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I would say…

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, number one, keep it short, okay? So, remember we talked about… up here, we talked about the time in the interview?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, you don't want to come into the interview, in my opinion, the most important time of the interview is the.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: behavioral-based questions they're gonna ask. That's what they're gonna mostly grade you on, right?

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, my advice for the intro is keep it pretty short, don't regurgitate everything on your resume.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, I would keep my intro to, like, a minute or two minutes, and if they ask more questions, sometimes you have people in the interview who are very, you know.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: curious Charlies who just will go, oh, that's interesting, uh, oh, okay, you went to Iowa State, huh? Yeah, is that… oh, how about those cyclones? Did you… were you at Iowa State? And, yeah, I have my nephew at Iowa State, and blah, blah, blah. I mean, you have to keep going, right? But for your own.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Redouane: Thank you.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: introduction, 1 to 2 minutes. I would say my name. My name is Redouan.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I studied electrical engineering, um, and I'm really passionate about these areas. I got into engineering, um, because of this, and this is what really has me interested in your guys' company.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh, the role specifically really, you know, stood out to me because I'm passionate about these things, and I really want to work in this area.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, maybe one of my favorite projects I've worked on in the past, or one of my favorite experiences was this project. It really gave me the chance to do XYZ. Um, two of my favorite classes in school were.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: my power… my power class and my circuits class, I really enjoyed those classes, and they challenged me in these kinds of ways, and I'm really happy and thankful for the opportunity to interview here today, and uh…

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'm happy to be here with you guys. You know, that short. You don't need to go, because they've already read your resume, they've already seen your projects, they've already seen…

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Redouane: Okay.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, and then if they say, oh, okay, well, that… oh, so what'd you like about that circus class? Oh, I took that, I remember that, did you… did you guys deal with this and this and that? Oh, yeah. You can answer whatever they ask you, but…

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: From your end, 1 to 3 minutes.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And you want to use most of your time on the interview itself, on the behavioral-based questions.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, maybe state…

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, name, you could even say, like, where you're from…

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Degree, why you're interested, passionate about…

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Engineering…

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: for electrical engineering.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Why you're interested, their company, or the position.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Maybe…

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: One favorite work experience…

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: One favorite…

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Class…

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Why?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Redouane: I'm, uh, I'm more… more of a… coming in as a… as a junior, or…

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Redouane: you know, just junior. Then, then, like, fresh out of, uh, school, just because I have, like, hands-on experience, and, and also…

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Redouane: I want to avoid that low bowling…

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Redouane: Uh, prices. So, mostly, I'm gonna be talking from… from experience.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, that's fine. I would just still cover…

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Redouane: I'm gonna give you a few questions, uh, specific to…

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Redouane: to this job that I will be having tomorrow, just…

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Redouane: Uh, to… to, um…

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Redouane: I know they're not… they may not be familiar, you're not familiar with the industry itself.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Redouane: But it's good that you might, like, just… just… just ask me questions, and then…

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Redouane: Um, try to answer them, you know?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Sure.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Redouane: Because they will be…

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Redouane: Uh… specific to the company itself.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Redouane: And then from your feedback, it's gonna help me tailor my…

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Redouane: Answers. Yeah, it's not doing anything.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Redouane: Okay, it's not doing anything…

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Redouane: Copy…

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Redouane: Doing paste…

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Redouane: Paste…

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Redouane: It's not doing anything for some reason, but…

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You're trying to put it in the chat here?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Redouane: Yeah. Isn't that the easiest part? The easiest way?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah. It should be working.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: if we just click on that chat at the very bottom… you didn't see the Toastmasters.org I put in there?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Redouane: Yeah.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Redouane: Yeah, I did, actually, and…

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh, okay.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Redouane: I'm gonna do… copy-paste…

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Redouane: Doesn't do anything, but I can type… test.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah, I see it, test.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Maybe just screenshot it, whatever you're trying to show me.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Redouane: Maybe that's better.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Redouane: Or I can do, question by question, see.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Or if it's a website, just paste the website and I can scroll. Or you could share your screen, too, if you want right now.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Redouane: Cost.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Redouane: Oh, this is… this is, uh…

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh, there we go.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Redouane: Questions from…

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Redouane: From GPT, basically.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Redouane: And you can ask me, like, the common one, maybe, like, to introduce yourself.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so you want me to ask you these, and just go as, like, a real mock interview?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Redouane: If you want, but at the same time.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah, let's go through one of them. Let's go through one of them, and I'll give you some… some feedback live.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Redouane: Or, or maybe just do the basic ones, you know, like…

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Redouane: you know, introduce yourself, and that kind of stuff. That's the main…

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Redouane: Once that's…

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, well, let's go through, like… we'll go through right now a mock…

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: of…

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um…

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'll pretend here we're just joining the interview, I'm gonna introduce myself, I'm gonna… I'm gonna do, like, what I would do in a normal interview at John Deere. We'll go through the intro section.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Then we'll go into the first behavioral-based question.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Redouane: Okay.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And, um…

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I guess you can pick what you want out of all of these, which one you want me to ask you? Well, maybe…

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Redouane: Okay, how are you?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Redouane: Okay.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So you tell me from now, so I'll just make it flow, we'll go right into the first question. After we finish the first question.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Redouane: Go ahead.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: We'll break character, and we'll talk about what happened.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Redouane: Okay.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Which question do you want to… I mean, try to pick one that's more…

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Redouane: Just the beginning one, like, the basic ones.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, this is a very common one, yeah, in the beginning. Okay.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Redouane: Okay.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Ready?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Redouane: Yeah.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, good evening, thanks for joining us. My name is Amansur, I'm going to be conducting your interview here today.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, just a short introduction on myself. I, um, have about 9 years of engineering experience. Um, I've worked at a couple different places. I've worked for the Iowa DOT.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And I've worked for John Deere for the past 8 years, and actually recently just left there to start my own, um…

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: my own business. Um, I studied mechanical engineering at Iowa State University.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And, um, we're happy to have you here to interview today, and I would just ask you to take a few minutes. I've looked at your resume already, um, and seen kind of some of the work you've done, and you've got a pretty good list of.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: experiences here. Maybe you can just take a few minutes, introduce yourself. If there's anything else that you want us to know that's not on the resume, um, just go ahead and take a few minutes to.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: To do a quick introduction, and then we can jump into the first interview question.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Redouane: Yeah, uh, first of all, I want to thank you for the opportunity, because, um, I really, really…

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Redouane: I appreciate the company, and uh… I've always, uh…

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Redouane: had a lot of respect for SEL as a company, or GE or whatever, but I'll just name the company.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Redouane: Uh, yeah, my name is Redouan. I am originally from Morocco. I went to Iowa State for electrical engineering, with emphasis in power.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Redouane: power studies. I have 3 plus years of experience working on utility scale protection and control systems.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Redouane: for renewable energies. I have hands-on experience as well, working on relay panels and, uh…

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Redouane: uh, enclosures, uh, including, uh, SEL, your company.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Redouane: And, uh, GE, Military Line, and ABB, and uh…

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Redouane: Uh, Siemens.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Redouane: Uh, these hands-on experience, uh, made me appreciate, uh, engineering as a whole.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Redouane: And, uh, it led me to want to continue my education here in the United States.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Redouane: And I also led factory acceptance testing.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Redouane: For, uh, over 50, uh, systems that were…

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Redouane: delivered to utility companies across the U.S, and uh… we've also.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Redouane: Had some, uh, abroad, uh…

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Redouane: Customers.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Redouane: Uh, I guess my, uh… what's not on the resume is that, uh…

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Redouane: I am, uh, passionate about sales and customer-facing, uh.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Redouane: Uh, roles that, uh…

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Redouane: Um, I was building, uh, I was building skills for, um, and now I am ready to transition to that field.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Redouane: Uh, using my multicultural, uh, uh, experience and also my, my linguistics. I speak French and, uh, Arabic fluently and, uh.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Redouane: My dream is to grow with the company, and hopefully…

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Redouane: Represent the company overseas.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay. Thanks for sharing that. That's… that's, uh, quite the background there. If you don't mind me asking.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Redouane: Thanks.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: How, you know, most engineers are kind of, uh, you know, they run the other direction when they hear the word sales, so…

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh, what kind of got you interested in sales, coming from the background you came from and having studied electrical engineering?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Redouane: I've always wanted to bridge the gap between sales and engineering.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Redouane: Uh, engineering was, for me, a way to leverage my…

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Redouane: uh, skill as a salesperson. I want to be able to, uh, speak with all teams from the…

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Redouane: Hands-on people, technicians, uh, the, um…

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Redouane: the designers and all types of, uh, engineers, and I thought, you know.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Redouane: I had to start somewhere, so I was strategically thinking, um, why not, you know, put some effort into.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Redouane: working as a technician first, and then build up my skills to design, which I did for a couple years, and then, uh…

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Redouane: Uh, as I got my degree recently, I wanted to follow my passion for sales, and.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Redouane: I like to close deals, I like to work with multidisciplinary teams and.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Redouane: like I said, I like bridging the gap between technical side and also.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Redouane: The sales side of things, or the business side of things.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, yeah, that's… that's really interesting. It's… you sound very passionate when you talk about it, so it comes through, um…

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: When you talk about bridging that gap between technical and the business side.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, we're gonna jump in here now to the first, um, actual interview question, behavioral question.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And remind you again that we're looking for the star format here, so if you highlight your answer in terms of the situation you were involved in, the task that you were assigned to do, or that you had to do.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The actions that you yourself took and the result of those actions, that'll help, you know, keep you on track for sticking with these.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Redouane: God, I wanna… I wanna see the… I wanna see that face… those notes.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Oh, you want me to share the notes back?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Redouane: Again… where is it?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Hold on a second, I unshared it, let me share it again.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Redouane: I mean…

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Redouane: Yeah, I would just screenshot it and put it in front of me. It's gonna help me, because this is on the fly, I didn't do…

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: No, no, yeah, it's fine.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Redouane: in your homework, but I kind of have an idea of what I'm gonna be talking about.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Here, I'll zoom out so you can see it all.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Redouane: Yeah, I'll just take a quick screenshot.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, ready for the first question?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Redouane: Yes, sir, yep.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, the first question is around the competency of customers and communication.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, can you tell me about a time you had to explain a complex technical issue to a non-technical customer?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Redouane: Usually when we do the FAT process, we work with engineers, but sometimes we do get, uh, uh.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Redouane: personal or private customers, uh, usually from Asia.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Redouane: And they're not engineers. They're… they're international customers that they happen to have the means to build the.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Redouane: A new, uh, substation or something like that, and they're not technical.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Redouane: So, the, uh… the best way to approach this is to…

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Redouane: Think about the whole system as a separate entities, and then…

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Redouane: when you walk them through the, uh, FAT, uh…

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Redouane: Process, you basically, um…

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Redouane: Uh, explain to them, um, exactly what… what… what each…

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Redouane: Step, uh, will, will func- so you, you, you first give them the, the whole, you know, the functionality of the whole system, and then you break it into parts.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Redouane: To kind of give them a visual map of what's going on.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Redouane: They don't have to understand everything, but at least they can see their product in action, like, energized and everything.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Redouane: And usually, that gives them a good sense of, uh…

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Redouane: Satisfaction and, and, and they're usually happy that you take the time and explain to them.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Redouane: Um, exactly what…

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Redouane: What their system is going to be performing in the field.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Redouane: I don't even remember the question.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Redouane: Exact question. And let's see…

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay. Okay.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Let's… so the question was…

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Tell me about a time… okay, so now we're… we're out of character, okay?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Redouane: Tell me about the time you had to explain complex… yeah, so, so I was, I was, uh, giving you a situational where a customer is not, uh, you know, an engineer.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Redouane: Uh, describe where customer, uh… okay, so the… yeah, so… so my task was to explain to them.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Redouane: And the action is to break it apart. The result is they're happy and satisfied.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Redouane: And, uh, I probably should just be, like, uh…

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Redouane: Uh, from there, I learned to make packets, uh, with visuals.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Redouane: For non-engineering, uh, uh, customers to, uh, walk them through the, uh, common, uh.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Redouane: Pieces of the substation to explain to them visually what's happening.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Redouane: And, um…

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Redouane: from… from that… from that point, uh, on, I… I distributed those packets.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Redouane: Uh, throughout the… all the teams, just in case, uh, he… he needed a further, uh…

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Redouane: Further, uh, information.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, this is what I documented here from your answer.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, right off the bat, I'll say a couple pieces of feedback.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Number one, and this will just come with…

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: This will just come with practice and repetitions, okay? And by the way, that was about…

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Redouane: Yes, sir.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: About 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Redouane: I didn't even take my time.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Redouane: Like, I didn't… I was… I felt like I spoke too much, but I really didn't.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You didn't, yeah, you probably… your answer should probably be more like 6 to 8 minutes, right?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Redouane: Right, right.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, right off the bat, a lot of ums, and a lot of stumbling, and a lot of…

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Redouane: Yeah, that comes from lack of practice and also on-the-fly answers. Like, these things, I just come up with it. I didn't even sit down and think about…

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: For sure.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'm not… I'm not trying to roast you, I'm just… I'm giving you exactly what happened. Yeah, yeah.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Redouane: No, it's good, man! You don't… you have no idea how much I'm appreciating right now.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So… so that will come with practice. The second big thing I would say is…

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: There was not a very clear…

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Delineation between situation, task, action.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: results. This is what a lot of people have trouble with, too, when you don't… when you're not practiced, is…

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Everything kind of just flows in, right? You kind of almost want to sound.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: it's gonna sound like a little bit cheesy, like, if you do it right, but you want to say, like, okay, you know, the situation that I was in was blah blah. Okay, I was tasked with.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The task that I had to accomplish was this, this, this. Okay, here's what I did to do that. You don't have to say, here's the actions, but it's…

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Redouane: Sometimes it's, it's, it's especially in English, sometimes it's just good to be direct and, and, you know.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah. Just use the terminology that they can catch it and follow along, right? So…

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Redouane: Right. Right.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: it was kind of hard. I mean, you see here, like, I didn't even write actions and results because I couldn't tell when you're actually jumping into.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so be clear when you're in the situation, when you're gonna move to the task.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Be clear, right? This is the task. This is the action. Yeah, so be clear about that.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Redouane: And those are the good speakers, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The other thing is, like we talked about, right? Uh…

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: did not paint the pain, right? We just kind of went right into, like, we work with some engineers, we get private customers from Asia, they're international customers.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: We didn't really talk about, like, what's the stakes here? Like, why is this important? What happens if we don't do this for them? What's the implications? What's the money implication? All that stuff, right? We didn't really paint it up to be a.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Redouane: These are… these are money maker, uh, multi-million dollar, uh.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Impressive.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Redouane: Uh, uh, business opportunities, and they… they need to understand what's going on with language barriers and, uh.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Redouane: Uh, lack of, uh, technical knowledge, we… they might… they might choose our competitors, for example.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: See, like, that is amazing detail to put in the beginning, right? Now the stakes are like, hey.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Redouane: Yeah.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I had an impact on…

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: My company losing business to our competitors.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Redouane: Yeah, you see the difference between that and now those packets means a lot of money.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: This is just like…

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, this, the way… the first way we present it is just like, ah, just…

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Redouane: Yep.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Sometimes we meet with these guys and we talk about some things.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Redouane: You're fucking good, man, I'm telling you.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Redouane: My problem.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Thank you. So, that's the… that's the third part. Um…

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The other… the last big piece, I would say… well, okay, here's a couple. The la- the next piece is…

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Um, you want the example…

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: to be…

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: A specific time. Okay, this is another one that people really struggle with, okay?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You have to always remember, when they're asking you the question, right, really, like, latch your brain onto the first part of this.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Tell me about A Time.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, and if you frame your mind in this way, it will help with the situation, task, actions, results, painting the pain.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You have to just get your mind in this mode of, they want a time, not like.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: a general job responsibility that you did many times, we want one incident, right? Like, if someone says.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Redouane: Specific, uh-huh.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, okay, again, I'll just go back to McDonald's, because it's easy to understand for both of us.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, you worked at McDonald's. Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult customer.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I don't want to answer that question and say, well, sometimes people come in, and their orders are late, and they get upset, and you have to help them and deal with them, and you try to calm them down. Oh, that's not A time. I'm saying tell them about one specific incident.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Redouane: Sometimes, yeah.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So the answer to that would be, one time, this woman ordered this huge order for a birthday.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And we completely forgot about it, we missed it, she showed up at 6 o'clock, we had nothing ready for her.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: She was so pissed, she called management, right? Like, that's…

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: A time. I'm trying to emphasize the word A, a specific time.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, you might… okay, this example can be very strong, right? We already talked about.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: adding to pain and the situation, but could we talk about a specific time you met with this customer from Asia, one of those instances.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Did something stand out that was specifically more complex to explain to them? Was there some specific one incident where there was a communication error and you had to resolve it, right? So.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Think, think about in terms of A time. I don't want to beat a dead horse here, get annoying, but like.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Redouane: No, no, no, be specific, yeah.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The one… a specific time, that will help you a lot to… everything will flow better.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: If you keep your mind in, don't think of a job responsibility that happens many times. Give them one time, one story, one incident.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, then the other piece here…

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You didn't really lay out the actions, like.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Clearly, like, this kind of ties in with this one here, right? We didn't really delineate between the.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: the phases themselves, but then even if I just ignore that and say the actions, like, okay.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You said the best way to approach this is…

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You don't want to say, I did this.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: When you walk them through this, you explain to them what you did.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You show them the whole function, break it into parts, they get a map, they don't understand everything, they can see their product energized and working. It's not really like a bullet, a numbered list.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: First, so every time, you know.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Redouane: Let me ask you, do you like this? It just needs to be structured better? Do you like the example itself? Is it okay?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The example… the example is good if you add the other components to it, right? It's a… it's a…

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Redouane: Okay.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: From the foundation, it's a prime example of explaining technical to non-technical people.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Redouane: You know, it's bullshit, right? Like, a lot of examples are gonna be bullshit or imaginary, right? Like, I've never really dealt with a lot of customers that.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Redouane: You know, that kind of stuff, you know? But you have to, for specific jobs, you have to.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Redouane: Show some customer, uh, interaction, you know?

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, all the details of this, then, you're getting from ChatGPT?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Redouane: No, from my head, from my mind, from my… just on the fly.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, well that's, like…

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I wouldn't advise that, because if they start to ask detailed follow-up questions, you could…

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Redouane: No, I can, I can. It's something I can build on and, and structure. It's just that, I guess my biggest question to you is, do you like.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Redouane: this specific, uh, example to be used, because I will vet it and be like, hey, work on this and get it structured.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, I think the basic fundamental elements of it, it fits the competency and the question, right?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Redouane: Okay, good, good.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But you have to add into this all these things and again, we don't really have any evidence here too of.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Redouane: Yes.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Of these two. We don't have any evidence of going above and beyond. We don't have any evidence of spreading the impact further, right? So you have.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Redouane: No, I did. I did… when you mentioned it, then I did. I said, uh, made packets for new customers, and then I spread them throughout the company.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay. Okay.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Fair enough.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Redouane: So, whenever they have questions, we can show them.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Fair enough, yeah, you just want to, like, really highlight that, and, and…

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Redouane: So it needs to be structured and systematically delivered.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah. And the last piece I would say, at least at this point, that I can think of, is…

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The results are vague, general, so you want to, like, make those results, like.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, they were satisfied. No, you want to say, like…

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: We were able to prove to them.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: That their system, when it got energized or, you know, whatever the example is, like, working with us would make their system.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: 20% better than our competitor, or we were able to prove to them that our cost would be 10% less.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh, this, this, you know, we had reviews from their leadership team across the board. We decided to go forward with this. This led to.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: projects that made our company, you know, over $10 million as a result of these, you know, you want to have… the result should be something metric, measured, tangible.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Redouane: Uh huh.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: It should never just be, they were happy, it was good, things were great, people were satisfied, it's way too vague.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So…

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: that overall, I think if you apply that stuff and the stuff we talked about in the beginning.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Redouane: You have no idea, man.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You're getting to very strong examples.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Redouane: Thank you.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay? I actually… I have kind of a hard cutoff at 8.30, Habibi, but, um…

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Redouane: No, when you tell me that Habibi, it means, like, uh, fuck off. You know, like, I have family.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: No.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Not in my culture, no, no, no, no, I don't.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Redouane: Uh, but you have no idea how much I've… I appreciate it, brother. Thank you.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: No problem, bro, man. Anytime, man, anytime. Just reach out if you need something else, and…

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Redouane: Allah, and you surprise me every time I talk to you. I don't know how this guy become this good at this field that…

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Redouane: Did you… did you… were you… were you, like, involved in, uh, hiring processes and stuff?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, I hired a lot of people and went to a lot of recruitment events.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Redouane: Yeah, that makes sense.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Redouane: That makes sense, because, like, the way you talk, the way…

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: And for myself, you know, like, honestly, I don't, I don't, you know…

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I don't like to brag too much or anything, but as a statement of fact.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: The level I reached at John Deere before I quit.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You know, it takes most people that reach the level that I was at, it's usually about 15 years, 15 to 17 years.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Redouane: What level of what? Like, I know you're smart, but, like, what are you talking about? Like…

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Like, position in the company, like, salary grade, like, like, in the structure, in the org chart.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Redouane: Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: you know, most people, it's like 15 to 17, 18 years, right? I mean…

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Redouane: Did you do any FE or PE, or…

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I did it, I did it in 6 years.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Redouane: But did you take any FEs or PE?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I took the FE after school, but for mechanical, it doesn't really do you very much.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Redouane: Well…

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Usually, like, I think electrical matters more, civil definitely civil is a big deal.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Redouane: Do you recommend it?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: If your company doesn't require it, or if you're… the field you're going into doesn't really need it, I wouldn't waste my time.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Redouane: Yeah, I just want to sell things, man. I want to be able to make good money for my family. I wanna be able to get my laptop and go see my mom, you know, and…

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Dude, good. I mean, engineering, I mean, I left the engineering job, but man, you can make.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Redouane: Right.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: in a couple years, especially now, especially electrical, man, the pay is better. You can make a comfortable living, man. You can make a good.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Well past 6 figures, with a good bonus, and vacation, benefits, you know, it's a… it's not a bad setup.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Redouane: Yeah.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Redouane: Yeah, that's all I want… that's all I want, brother. That's all I want. And…

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Then you use that as your base, and you figure out what's the next step, and you just keep going from there, man.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Redouane: Yeah.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Redouane: Yeah, yeah.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Redouane: I'm saying, God bless you, man. Seriously, Allah. Thank you so much.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Wayak, inshaAllah.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Redouane: And then, and then do you, uh, before you leave, do you like these questions? Do you think I need to, or is it going to be a waste of time?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Redouane: do I need to build on these each scenario, and then start using your guidance to…

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Redouane: Uh, answer each… each one of them, and then proxy…

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I think you have… I think you have too many questions there, okay? Honestly. So if you think about… okay, let me, uh…

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Redouane: Okay, okay.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I'll share quickly here with you, and I can email this to you, too, after…

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Redouane: Yeah, luckily.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: When's your interview? Is it scheduled?

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Redouane: Tomorrow at 2.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Okay, so I'll email this to you tonight. I got some things I have wrapped up. I'll get back on my computer later, and I'll email this to you quick.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Redouane: Hmm.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Redouane: Go for it. Hey, do you… just quick, do you, do you play music? Like, do you play guitar?

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Uh, yeah, I mean, I started learning. I haven't practiced much lately, but I tried to learn a little bit just as a hobby, but…

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Redouane: What?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000

Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Devaka?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Redouane: But bro, did you change, like, you were a little bit too religious, right?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Redouane: Like, doom back, Haram…

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Redouane: No.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Redouane: But now, now, now, now, can you… do you… can you listen to music?

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, I listen to music.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Redouane: Okay, good, good.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: But I still pray 5 times and things, I'm not, I left this whole Salafi mindset of any kind of.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Redouane: Alhamdulillah.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Redouane: Yeah, alhamdulillah, yeah, alhamdulillah. You know, here and there, you know, like, nothing crazy, but.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we still listen to Quran predominantly, I don't, you know, it doesn't consume my life, you know.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Redouane: Oh, yeah, of course, that's the medicine.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, I'll send this to you, Redouane. This, from what I know, my experience and stuff, right, you just…

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: I tried to pick the 10 competencies, actually, there's like 6 or 7 competencies that really.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Redouane: We already have them, yeah.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: Yeah, they cover everything. You don't need to really try to have an answer for every single question that you sent me.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You just need to have an answer for every competency. You shouldn't be able to use… if one question answers one competency, it's…

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Redouane: Of course, it can…

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: it's pretty good to use at other places, you just have to think a little harder, yeah.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Redouane: It can be… right, yeah, it can be translated easily.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: So, think, especially with this short time, go through the competencies and say, do I have.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: two examples I could use for each competency. Don't try to answer every question. You'll be up until 2 o'clock to the interview, and then…

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Redouane: Mm-hmm.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Mansour Manci | Launch To Lead: You won't do well because you'll be burned out.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
