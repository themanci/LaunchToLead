Launch Path Strategy Session (Sayid Sirojev) - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Sayid Sirojev: Hello.
Mansour Manci: Hello.
Sayid Sirojev: How's it going?
Mansour Manci: Good. How are you?
Sayid Sirojev: Not bad. Is it Mansour? Am I saying it correctly?
Mansour Manci: Mansour. Yeah, very close.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah. Yeah.
Mansour Manci: And your seed.
Sayid Sirojev: Uh say.
Mansour Manci: Do you pronounce it?
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Okay. I was trying to figure out where that where that's based on your the name sounds familiar like a Muslim name.
Sayid Sirojev: Say
Mansour Manci: I know a lot of like you know Muslim people, but I couldn't tell based on your picture. Like are you uh like Pekkiststan area? Is that where your family's from?
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah. Yeah, you actually got that correct.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: Wow. Right on the spot there.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: Uh yeah. Um I guess I can introduce myself. Um yeah, like you said, my name is uh Sedroj.
Mansour Manci: Sure.
Sayid Sirojev: I'm a part-time student quality engineer at John Deere Seating.
 
 
00:01:03
 
Sayid Sirojev: I uh support the weld and paint operations.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: Uh I attend St. Ambrose University in Davenport. I'm assuming you're in the area as well.
Mansour Manci: Okay. Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: Quad cities area.
Mansour Manci: I'm I'm based out of syllabus.
Sayid Sirojev: Nice.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: Okay, nice. Um, I'm majoring in mechanical engineering and industrial and I'm a sophomore,
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: technically a junior by my credits, but it's my second year. So,
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: I've been with Deer for almost nine months now. I joined in May 2025 and Yep.
Mansour Manci: Yeah, saw that on your LinkedIn. Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: So,
Mansour Manci: How do you like it?
Sayid Sirojev: that's where I'm at now.
Mansour Manci: How how do you like it so
Sayid Sirojev: Uh,
Mansour Manci: far?
Sayid Sirojev: it's good. You know, I like I think I'm learning a a lot. Um, you know, my co-workers are amazing and my team's supportive, especially with my school hours,
Mansour Manci: Cool.
Sayid Sirojev: too.
 
 
00:01:49
 
Sayid Sirojev: I, uh, I have a lot of questions and, you know, my team's always there to answer those questions. So, I'm glad for
Mansour Manci: Yeah, the part-time student gig is really,
Sayid Sirojev: that.
Mansour Manci: really, really nice. I mean, I came in as an EDP. I didn't have any internship, part-time student experience with deer or anything like that, but so the EDP program was really, really, really, really good. I was glad to see that like in your when you fill out that questionnaire thing for the meeting. So, that's a really good target to have. But the part-time student think I think u gives you a big leg up too. Did you I didn't see on LinkedIn but you didn't have any internship uh like the summer of your freshman year. You you've been a part-time you still so you would have started the part-time student thing. Okay. Okay. So that was your first summer thing was time student.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
 
 
00:02:32
 
Sayid Sirojev: I I finished my freshman year and then that summer I started basically.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: Um the year before that I interned at the city of Molen as an administrative intern but that's that was a different internship.
Mansour Manci: Yeah, I saw that. Okay. And for the part-time student,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: do you stay so like you'll stay in the OFP quality engineer role but for like the rest of your college or do they move you around every every year, every six months or is it based on like
Sayid Sirojev: Uh so yeah it's year round.
Mansour Manci: request?
Sayid Sirojev: Um right now I'm sticking in what I got hired on to. My manager is flexible to moving me around.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: Uh I'm not sure are you familiar with the factory how the factory set up and all the OFP tubes.
Mansour Manci: Yeah,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah. Yeah.
Mansour Manci: I've been I've been to the seating factory a bunch of times.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: I used to be the software PB&V supervisor for seating and tillage.
 
 
00:03:20
 
Mansour Manci: So,
Sayid Sirojev: Oh
Mansour Manci: I haven't spent a ton of time there, but yeah,
Sayid Sirojev: yeah.
Mansour Manci: I was in that role until June of last year. So, I've been there a couple times.
Sayid Sirojev: Right. So yeah,
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: I mean my manager is open to moving me to assembly or any any other part of the factory, but right now with my part-time school or with my school hours, you know, weld and paint kind of fills up my time.
Mansour Manci: Yeah. Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: And you it looks like too you mentioned that you want to and you mentioned in the messages like you want to try to get to product
Sayid Sirojev: Right. Yeah. Um yeah, I'm interested in product development.
Mansour Manci: development.
Sayid Sirojev: You know, I've uh been talking to a couple of the teams. You know, I'm open to job shadows during the summer when we're on uh summer shutdown at the factory.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: So, I was probably thinking about job shadowing probably some of the software dev teams, PVNV, and maybe I think I know they have different teams focused on like different disciplines like for product development like electrical, mechanical.
 
 
00:04:19
 
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah,
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: I'm not really too sure on that, but I've been messaging a couple people and yeah,
Mansour Manci: Yeah. Sure.
Sayid Sirojev: getting some stuff set up.
Mansour Manci: There's some people there like even if you just so outside of my coaching business,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: if you just message me on Teams at work on Monday or whatever, send me an email. I can connect you with a few people on the seating side of like the product development side at Sylvvis. That would be just like interesting managers for you to talk to, I think, to explore that side. But you know I will say a couple things quickly. Um getting that factory experience is amazing. So even if you end up going into product engineering and you end up just being at Silvis like at the product development center or somewhere else in water whatever I don't know you know where your career takes you but many times I've seen people who've factory experience it just it connects all the dots for you in terms of how you function as an engineer how you deliver your piece of the puzzle and at the end of the day we're delivering some physical thing most of us right unless we work for ISG we have some digital solution, but you know, if you're working on a physical product to be able to understand how the factory works and what are the limitations there and what am I doing right now that's going to make people at the factory hate me or like me,
 
 
00:05:33
 
Mansour Manci: right? Like it's a you know, not everybody gets that experience. And you know this call we have very limited time but you know if we work together over the course of these sessions you know if that if we move forward with that that's a big thing that I would I would lay out too for you too as far as when you get into that EDP program like using your time as a part-time student to maximize what you can see maximize what you can learn and strategically place yourself in like the least ven diagram overlapping roles you can mind like you you want to build your base as wide as you possibly can, right? And it's helpful as a part-time student, as an EDP, not only to do stuff that really diversifies your experience early on because that will help you advance your career long term way more than anything else. And also taking the chance on some roles that you might know, I don't want to do this for five years, but I could stomach it for eight months.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
 
 
00:06:33
 
Mansour Manci: I can get that experience, get that knowledge, you know,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: like being an OFP um like factory engineer like for example seating we go through these peaks and valleys of production but like if I was there at engine works or if I was there there's other places where that OFP role is just you know people get ground into dust after two three years and they just it's the hours are insane but you could say well you know that's an example you've already got the OFP experience but these kinds of roles where you go ah I wouldn't want to be there for three years but I could get in and out in eight months and learn a ton and that would help me later on in my career, you know, in a lot of broad different ways. So, there's a lot of strategic planning and thinking, I think, behind the rest of your time as a part-time student and especially in your EDP rotations that I think would be like really good conversations to have. Um, but you know, in addition to that, like in my opinion, for where you're at right now, you're very well situated, but also I don't really know, you know, what deer looks like when you graduate, right?
 
 
00:07:32
 
Mansour Manci: We're all kind of in this boat of uncertainty, economy, farmers aren't doing well. So to me, I think it's smart that you reached out and that you are thinking about these things. A lot of people approach me so far. You know, I've only started this business like three, four months ago. I've been coaching people informally, like not professionally, just for eight years, but they reach out like a month before they graduate.
Sayid Sirojev: Hey, monster. I think you're uh muted.
Mansour Manci: Oh, okay. Sorry.
Sayid Sirojev: Oh,
Mansour Manci: Uh,
Sayid Sirojev: now you're fine.
Mansour Manci: you're in a much better situation though to attack things early. And I think, um, a lot of the things I teach, at least like in the launch program, would be beneficial and useful for when you're trying to get that first job to help make sure that gets secured whether it's at Deer or not. Right. And that's another piece of it is, you know, I enjoy being at Deer.
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: It's it's been good to me.
 
 
00:08:23
 
Mansour Manci: I've had a lot of opportunity. But, you know, that's not to say that that's your destiny, right? Just because you started as a part-time student. I mean, if you if you want it to be, great. If you don't, there's tons of opportunity in the world, right? That all these experiences could be leveraged for a great starting role at Deer or outside of Deer, right? Whatever you choose to move forward with. So, um, yeah, I think it'd be it's good to at least get a a head start on it, start understanding strategically how to position yourself. And and the other big piece of it too, like you know, you've got two more years of college, a lot of people like when they start going to interview for positions and they want to get their first job, they're like trying to, you know, scrape all their college experiences and find the good stuff, find the valuable stuff, find the gold nuggets. But if you're proactive and you're already planning and thinking ahead and you know what your strategy is going to be when you start interviewing, when you start searching for your first position, it means now while you're going through those last two years, you're strategically picking good projects and picking good things that are going to highlight your skills that are going to serve you well down the road.
 
 
00:09:30
 
Mansour Manci: Right? So, it's the advantages of being proactive like this are I mean it's it's it's I think it's
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah,
Mansour Manci: fairly obvious, but I can't state it enough that I think the value is is really really really big.
Sayid Sirojev: right.
Mansour Manci: So, um yeah, I've got I mean I've got a couple, you know, I can show you kind of like the blueprint of what kind of the the curriculum looks like, what we kind of cover. Um and I I could just share my screen here and cover that um you know, fairly quickly. Then if you have questions about it or if you are curious like you know if certain things topics would be covered if there's things that you're more interested in right we can you can just feel free I mean jump in at any point really and uh I can try to address those but hopefully you can see my screen at this point.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah,
Mansour Manci: Okay. So basically I I I've uh boiled it down to really three sessions that are 90 minutes
 
 
00:10:16
 
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: each. And for a couple people that have gone through it already, you know, they've if if people really feel like they want they got a lot of benefit out of the last session, which is like a full mock interview deep dive. Some people have asked to do a fourth session and I just tacked it on for for free just to do another like round of mock interviews. These are a lot of people who are like interviewing for stuff next week and two weeks from now.
Sayid Sirojev: Heat.
Mansour Manci: So, you know, that that might not make as much sense for you at this stage. But basically, you know, there's a bunch of material that I send to you before the first session starts and there's a bunch of different strategies, different mindset type of things that I'll send to you. You'll take some time, think about that. There's a couple little exercises to go through, try to start thinking about some of the concepts we're going to talk about and put some of your personal, you know, your actual situation examples down.
 
 
00:11:11
 
Mansour Manci: Then in the first session, it's pretty much heavily focused on resume. So I focus on I mean not only just writing your resume but I think it's important that you know people go to AI to write their resume and I mean AI can write you a resume that sounds cool but you know AI cannot extract your experiences from your brain and tell you which ones are the best most applicable ones and which ones will actually be impressive and get you noticed right I mean and I coach you in here how to use AI to help with your resume but you know you have to provide the the brick and mortar right and AI can polish it up and can make it look better and stuff like that and it can make it easier for you to organize it. But, you know, so I'm helping you extract whatever experiences you have to make them the most impactful they can be, telling you what details are important to add to highlight these things that'll feed into your interview preparation right from your resume.
 
 
00:12:04
 
Mansour Manci: So this is a lot of focus on resume trying to get your experiences highlighted in a way that's going to be really marketable and impactful to people who are going to come across your resume as you're you're going through the recruitment process. There'll be some, you know, material after session one and then before session two. Again, there'll be some kind of prep material you can read through. There'll be a couple little exercises to help get you ready for session two so that you come a little bit prepared and we make the best use of the time. Session two, the main focus is on your interview strategy and your story mastery. So, we're taking those, you know, some of the basic things we talked about in the resume in the first session, and now we want to really dig deep into your examples, your experiences, and how you would present them in a behavioral-based interview, right? I mean, John Deere is big on behavioral based interviews. I'm sure you're familiar at this point.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: In most yeah the star interviews in most other companies even if it's a tech company and they have a coding interview or something
 
 
00:12:52
 
Sayid Sirojev: Star.
Mansour Manci: technical there's always some element of a behavioral interview nowadays in most engineering roles. So we dive really deep here to figure out how to best sell your examples and your experiences to really do well in the interview. Then again there'll be some more material after session two, some pre-homework material before session three. Then session three will be, you know, a little bit of a briefing, but then mostly it'll be a full mock interview and I'll go in excruciating detail picking apart your answers, your examples, how to improve them, how to try to get those up to kind of the five-star level. Um, I'm not sure what the interview process is for part-time students, but you you went through a behavioral based interview probably to get that
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah,
Mansour Manci: position.
Sayid Sirojev: it was the uh business unit leader, factory engineering manager, uh my manager, and then uh one of the engineers on my team. So,
Mansour Manci: Okay.
Sayid Sirojev: it was a star. It was a star method interview.
Mansour Manci: Okay. So,
 
 
00:13:51
 
Sayid Sirojev: No,
Mansour Manci: yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: no technical interview.
Mansour Manci: Okay. So, we'll go through full mock interview here and I'll give you like really really brutally honest and and deep feedback and how to improve that and make you ready for an interview in the future. And this will also just kind of it'll bring everything we talked about in session one and session two into full clarity, how to see it in action. And and I think again like hearkening back to what I said about being proactive. You know, knowing how you're going to try to answer in the interview can help you too over the next two years of okay, I got to start organizing my examples and my experiences and thinking about the impact I'm having. I need to be thinking about documenting the metrics behind the work I'm doing. I need to be thinking about the business impact. So all these things that I'm going to want to highlight two years from now when I interview so I get that job that I really want. Now I have the information like you know I have the answers to the exam so I can really prepare myself and and make sure that I'm documenting and thinking about those things so that when I go interview you know I'm not grasping for straws and trying to trying to you know think of stuff that happened two years ago.
 
 
00:14:55
 
Sayid Sirojev: You're
Mansour Manci: Um so that's the kind of the main outline of of of the you know the official
Sayid Sirojev: right.
Mansour Manci: package that I offer. Um, and then in addition to that, whoever goes through this session can join the I have a school a school community. Right now it's completely free. Um, but even if at some point I monetize it. Whoever worked with me as a client will have free access to that forever. So through that you'd have access to me asking me questions. Let's say someday down the road, a year, two years, you're interviewing, you can reach out to me, get help, and then there's a community of people there in the same boat. You can get people to help you do a mock interview. you could post your resume, get people to give you more feedback, you know, so it's a smaller community of people who have the same goals as you, and you'd have access to that for free forever. And, you know, whenever you're going for a position, you'd have um good resources there, including myself, to help you, you know, with whatever questions you have and any preparation you
 
 
00:15:51
 
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: need.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah. Hey, thanks. Um, I know we're running short on time, but can I squeeze in a couple questions before we go?
Mansour Manci: Sure. Sure. Absolutely.
Sayid Sirojev: Um, so are we are you flexible like with your scheduling? I mean, I know you went through the package and it you labeled like the days and you split it up. Um, is it like consecutive? Do you like strictly follow the schedule?
Mansour Manci: So I try to do like my advice is to do it I I do right now like one session a week. I mean I can be flexible.
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: I mean that's just my kind of a guideline.
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: I feel like if we stretch them out and do once a month, by the time you come to session two, you're kind of trying to review, you know, so to keep you accountable,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: we're engaged. We're taking it seriously on both sides once a week. But if you said, "Hey,
 
 
00:16:32
 
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: I really can't do it. Let's do once every two week." I mean, I'm flexible. I mean, I just I'm I'm suggesting what I think will give you the most value, but I'm pretty flexible. If if if something needs to be spaced out one time more or less or whatever,
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: you know, it's not set in stone.
Sayid Sirojev: Right. And final question here. Um I look through job postings occasionally.
Mansour Manci: Sure.
Sayid Sirojev: I want to share my screen here. Uh let's see. Can you see my screen? All right. So here's an example job posting.
Mansour Manci: Yes.
Sayid Sirojev: I wanted to ask um should I like prepare now for like the skills that these jobs require later down the line. So I guess this is an example here. Let's see embedded software engineer product engineering. I scroll down here I see skills C C++ uh Visual Studio and then some other job postings I see in product engineering um they require mat lab or something called simulink.
 
 
00:17:28
 
Sayid Sirojev: I don't know what that what those are but I mean from your like in your opinion should I start preparing for
Mansour Manci: Yeah. Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: that now start learning those skills especially for product
Mansour Manci: I So if you really It depends on how narrow you really know you want to go
Sayid Sirojev: engineering
Mansour Manci: into, right? There's people who who I've met as interns are like my dad has worked for deer and
Sayid Sirojev: right
Mansour Manci: he's in this field and I know I want to do this and like I know ex like I want to be an engineer at ISG working on displays okay like if you really think you have it figured out that well start trying to build those skills but for other things like that are more broad like proficiency in C++ like that's going to help you endear in a in a lot of different roles right so even mat lab too as you learn about development like C++ is most of the handcoded stuff at deer. Mat lab is most of the modelbased stuff.
 
 
00:18:16
 
Mansour Manci: So like those are the two main things. Um like I wouldn't maybe get so pigeon holed into like really really really niche things. And if you're not sure how niche it is, you can ask people, right, and say like, "Hey, is this tool?" There's some tools like only one group at JDPs in Waterl uses and like three people use
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: it. Like I would not be trying to spend time learning that unless you know, hey, I really am going to join that group. That's my life's calling, right? But uh so that's how I would approach that.
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: But at the same time, another good piece of advice for you is if you see a posting that stands out to you, that you're interested in, screenshot it, save it, start building a database of these postings because I've had many times where yeah, you wish you can come back to it. And this new system, I don't know if it if it lets you like once you bookmark it, but once the posting is taken down, you can't really see this.
 
 
00:19:03
 
Mansour Manci: So, it's nice to see like, you know, do a just like a print to PDF or whatever you want to do, right? Screenshot it somehow. So you have this and you can keep it into one note and kind of start building out like okay these kinds of roles you'll start to notice similarities in them right when you you start to see oh okay in the last eight postings that I'm interested in they all have like 60% overlap with these skills okay those are probably like very apply applicable everywhere I better really work on those you know that's a really good thing too to to track the types of positions that you're interested in and then as you come up to your graduation you can always keep kind of doing an assessment of okay keep your resume up to date and you can do a comparison okay how far off am I from these dream jobs that I'm interested in right every maybe every two three four months every quarter maybe let's say you do an assessment and see okay am I getting closer am I closing that gap in terms of what skills they're looking for so that's a really good strategy that's also being very proactive I think that would put you like in the top 2% of people in terms of planning and like thinking ahead so
 
 
00:20:07
 
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: really good really good idea idea and I think it's really good.
Sayid Sirojev: Great.
Mansour Manci: But make sure you save them, screenshot them, print a PDF because they do have internally in deer,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: you can find a there's a system that shows you general highle description of like every job title uh not job title, you know, like if you have like product engineer one,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah,
Mansour Manci: right? Yeah. The job description catalog, but it you can't necessarily get like embedded software engineered level, right? It'll just give you like like maybe product engineer one
Sayid Sirojev: right. Right. Right. See if I can Yeah. I mean,
Mansour Manci: Yeah,
Sayid Sirojev: it's basically in here.
Mansour Manci: it'll give you like a very generic, but it's good to screenshot or print to PDF those specific postings because you get way more. Yeah. See, like this is very abstracted and just generic, right?
Sayid Sirojev: Yep.
Mansour Manci: It doesn't really tell you, oh, if I want to work as a embedded software engineer for seating and tillage on planters, like it's not going to be that um, you know,
 
 
00:21:03
 
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: domain specific.
Sayid Sirojev: Right. And do you know if EDPs do they have to go through like a tech technical interview especially for the software dev team?
Mansour Manci: Uh, no. They they don't typically. You might have like a,
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: you know, different managers might just have like a one-on-one with you and ask you some technical questions informally, but it should it shouldn't be part of like the actual HR hiring
Sayid Sirojev: Right. Right.
Mansour Manci: process.
Sayid Sirojev: Right. And there won't be like a make or break like, hey, I don't really know C++ for example. Okay. I mean, you don't know C++ then I guess you can't really work on our team. Is there any is that is there
Mansour Manci: typ typically for an EDP I mean you might just be less competitive against another candidate who has it and that's up to the hiring manager to decide but I mean
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: I got hired into embedded software roles as a mechanical engineer who didn't know how to write a single line of C at all.
 
 
00:21:58
 
Mansour Manci: So it also depends on how well you sell your experiences and how well you sell the other you know the other things you have and and uh it's very situational too like sometimes a hiring manager is hiring for potential sometimes he needs something delivered in six months so he needs to hire somebody who has certain skills not as much he's worried about how's this guy going to perform in 18 months right but the more you can add those the more competitive you'll be but there's no guarantee either way but it's typically not a like a hard where they'll
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: say okay you're no longer considered because you don't know
Sayid Sirojev: Right. Right. Yeah, that makes sense.
Mansour Manci: C++.
Sayid Sirojev: Okay. Yeah. I know. I mean, basically just work on that, try to build up my skills until I graduate. Um I mean it's just time management for me on my end. I feel like you know managing school and my work responsibilities and then this as well preparing
 
 
00:22:45
 
Mansour Manci: Sure.
Sayid Sirojev: for that. Yeah, that makes sense. Um have you ever seen like an engineer like who's been a factory engineer and in product development like go back and forth like throughout their career or is that typically not
Mansour Manci: There's quite a few. Yeah, there's quite a few.
Sayid Sirojev: seen?
Mansour Manci: When I when I moved to seating and tillage in in Silvis, there's quite a few who came from the factory. They either had a manufacturing type of position or, you know, I knew people back in Waterlue as well. So at that at that level, like when you're coming in as an EDP,
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: I mean, it's it's your part-time student experience really you should just see as like icing on the cake because they hire EDPs in from college who never had a single day of experience at John Deere, right? So you've got a competitive edge and you can kind of it's kind of a blank slate.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: Um, but if you wanted to do something in the factory,
 
 
00:23:30
 
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: you'd have a big advantage. But I think having that factory experience is good anywhere you go because knowing how the factory operates at the end of the day everyone's work feeds downream to the factory right so it's only help
Sayid Sirojev: Right. Right. Right. That makes sense. And let's say I wanted to be like a supervisor later down the line.
Mansour Manci: you
Sayid Sirojev: How long do you think it would take me to like accumulate the experience enough to like become a supervisor?
Mansour Manci: so okay like there are supervisor positions that start out at a salary grade
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: eight, right? You'd come into an as an EDP at a salary grade six. I mean, if you're very aggressive and you're very smart and you're strategic and you're like doing the right things and putting in extra
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: effort and doing a lot of these things that I coach on, you could probably get from a six to a seven reasonably. I mean, it depends on your division.
 
 
00:24:23
 
Mansour Manci: Like JDPS will move people from EDP to a seven right away. Some of them know they'll say you have to go from EDP to another salary grade six maybe two three years to move to a seven. So there could be a couple years more in there. But let's say from a six to a seven you might be looking at spending 18 months to 24 months after
Sayid Sirojev: right?
Mansour Manci: EDP in a six to get into a seven. Then from a seven to a supervisor you could be looking at anywhere between you know two to five two to four years depending on how aggressive you are.
Sayid Sirojev: All
Mansour Manci: And a lot of it is situational based on what position opened up, the opportunity, right? But I think like on the lower end of like being um optimistic,
Sayid Sirojev: right.
Mansour Manci: if you're very aggressive and you're a high performer, you do your job well and people notice you, I'd say like two years as a six, you can make it to a seven. And two to three years as a seven, you could make it to an eight supervisor
 
 
00:25:15
 
Sayid Sirojev: Right.
Mansour Manci: position.
Sayid Sirojev: That makes sense. And I don't want to like rush into it too like into it being a supervisor, but you know, I'm kind of motivated to climb the ladder and I know it's basically based on who
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: you know and who likes you.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: That that's what people tell me at
Mansour Manci: I mean I c I mean I I I went up pretty fast for the time that it took me.
Sayid Sirojev: least.
Mansour Manci: Like I know people who got to like a staff position level. Most people it's like probably 15 years, 16, 17 years, right? I did it in six and a half or something like that.
Sayid Sirojev: Wow.
Mansour Manci: So the the thing that most people don't realize too, which you're asking very good questions and most people think being a good engineer gets you promoted,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: but being a good engineer is the prerequisite, right? There's a whole other side of the game, which is, you know, visibility, impact, navigating that, building relationships, being likable, you know, to an extent, right?
 
 
00:26:07
 
Mansour Manci: You don't want to be a uh like a brown-noser or anything like that,
Sayid Sirojev: Heat.
Mansour Manci: but you know, if you're that guy who's always try dying on the hill of something that's really not that significant with your manager, you don't want like to like be annoying people above you,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: right? So, there's a lot of that like what they call soft skills. I think they're very important. So I don't like that that they're called soft skills, but that's like I think they're harder for most engineers to navigate and
Sayid Sirojev: You think they're hard skills?
Mansour Manci: implement, you know,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah.
Mansour Manci: but those are the things that will define that, right? When you get up to, you know, I I've in the position I'm in now, like I have a lot of visibility and exposure to directors and VPs and different people in the company. And you when you sit with most of them, you aren't telling yourself, "Oh my god, this guy's a genius. Like he must have had a 4.0 when he was in college." It's a completely different skill set.
 
 
00:26:57
 
Mansour Manci: So understanding that when you're coming in early and understanding that I have to do a good job technically as an engineer, but I have to work on making a brand for myself, reputation for myself. I need to make sure I'm working on projects that have a lot of visibility. I need to make sure I'm getting my manager to mention my name and to give me credit in certain circles. I, you know, all that stuff is like extra work on the side. And a lot of engineers think if I just come in here,
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah,
Mansour Manci: put my head down and just grind, oh man, I'm going to move up. Like, you know, you will move up eventually. But that difference between getting to a staff engineer in six years versus 18
Sayid Sirojev: right.
Mansour Manci: years.
Sayid Sirojev: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. All right. I don't want to keep you here for too long. Uh,
Mansour Manci: Sure.
Sayid Sirojev: thank you,
Mansour Manci: Sure.
Sayid Sirojev: by the way. It was uh nice meeting you.
Mansour Manci: Yeah.
Sayid Sirojev: Um, would you be open to like a copy chat or job shadow whenever later down the line?
Mansour Manci: Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Informally, too.
Sayid Sirojev: I could always I could always message you,
Mansour Manci: So, are you are you you want to continue forward like with the actual,
Sayid Sirojev: too.
Mansour Manci: you know, the program or or what do you
Sayid Sirojev: Uh, yeah,
Mansour Manci: think?
Sayid Sirojev: I would be. Um, I think I saw the offer online. What was it like $500?
Mansour Manci: Yeah. And you could do that.
Sayid Sirojev: Okay.
Mansour Manci: You could do that in, you know, payments if you want. If you do that like once, you know, every two weeks, I think, if we do, depending on how you want to time out the session. But I'm flexible, too, with that with pacing that out as well.
