Details
Introductions and Background Sayid Sirojev and Mansour Manci introduced themselves and their roles. Sayid Sirojev is a part-time student quality engineer at John Deere Seating, supporting weld and paint operations, while also majoring in mechanical and industrial engineering at St. Ambrose University in Davenport (00:00:00). Mansour Manci noted that they were previously the software PB&V supervisor for seating and tillage until June of last year, and are currently based out of Sylvvis (00:02:32).
Part-time Student Experience and Career Aspirations Sayid Sirojev expressed satisfaction with their role at Deer, citing a supportive team and learning environment, and mentioned having started the part-time student role after their freshman year, following an administrative internship at the City of Molen (00:01:03) (00:02:32). They also expressed interest in moving towards product development, having been in contact with a couple of teams, and planning to job shadow software development and PVNV teams during the factory's summer shutdown (00:03:20).
Strategic Career Advice and Factory Experience Mansour Manci emphasized the value of factory experience for an engineer, stating that it "connects all the dots" for understanding physical product delivery and factory limitations (00:04:19). They advised Sayid Sirojev to strategically maximize their experience as a part-time student and future EDP by diversifying their roles and choosing positions, even for a short duration, to broaden their skill base (00:05:33). Mansour Manci also offered to connect Sayid Sirojev with relevant managers in product development at Silvis (00:04:19).
Proactive Career Planning and Market Uncertainty Mansour Manci highlighted the importance of being proactive, noting that many individuals seek career coaching too late, close to graduation (00:07:32). They stressed that early planning allows for strategic selection of college projects to highlight skills for future interviews and job searches, both at Deer and elsewhere (00:08:23). Mansour Manci also acknowledged the current market uncertainty affecting the economy and farmers (00:07:32).
Career Coaching Program Outline Mansour Manci presented the structure of their coaching program, which consists of three 90-minute sessions (00:09:30). The first session focuses heavily on resume writing, emphasizing how to extract and highlight impactful experiences to make them marketable, even when utilizing AI (00:11:11). The second session concentrates on interview strategy and "story mastery," preparing participants for behavioral-based interviews (like the STAR method used at John Deere) (00:12:04). The third session involves a full mock interview with "brutally honest and deep feedback" to improve performance (00:12:52).
Program Logistics and Community Access Mansour Manci advised spacing the sessions out to about once a week for maximum value, though they are flexible if a less frequent schedule is needed (00:15:51). They also offered free, lifetime access to their "school community" for clients, which provides resources, help with interviews, and networking opportunities with people who have similar career goals (00:14:55). Sayid Sirojev confirmed interest in moving forward with the program, which was stated to be $500, with flexible payment options (00:26:57).
Advice on Skill Development and Job Posting Tracking Regarding job skill preparation, Mansour Manci suggested that Sayid Sirojev focus on broad skills like C++ and MatLab, which are frequently used at John Deere, rather than highly niche tools, unless they are certain about a specific career path (00:17:28). Mansour Manci strongly recommended proactively building a database of desired job postings by saving or screenshotting the specific descriptions, as this will help track required skills and assess career progress against them (00:18:16).
Insights on EDP Interviews and Career Advancement Mansour Manci clarified that EDP candidates typically do not undergo formal technical interviews, though technical questions may be asked informally by managers. They noted that a lack of specific skills like C++ might make a candidate less competitive, but it is not usually a hard prerequisite for an EDP role, and Mansour Manci shared that they secured an embedded software role as a mechanical engineer without C knowledge (00:21:03). For aspiring supervisors, Mansour Manci estimated the path from an EDP (salary grade six) to a seven could take 18 to 24 months, and then an additional two to four years from a seven to an eight supervisor position, depending on performance and opportunity (00:23:30).
Importance of Non-Technical Skills for Promotion Mansour Manci stressed that while being a good engineer is essential, non-technical skills (sometimes called "soft skills," which Mansour Manci considers "hard skills" for engineers) are crucial for rapid promotion. They advised proactively building a personal brand, seeking projects with high visibility, and ensuring managers mention and credit one's contributions to advance quickly, citing their own rapid progression in six and a half years (00:25:15) (00:26:57).

Suggested next steps
Sayid Sirojev will message or send an email to Mansour Manci on Teams at work on Monday or whatever to connect with managers on the seating side of product development at Sylvvis.
Sayid Sirojev will proceed with the coaching program that costs $500 and can be paid in installments.
Sayid Sirojev will screenshot, save, or print job postings to PDF and start building a database of these postings.
