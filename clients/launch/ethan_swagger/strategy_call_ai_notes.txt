Details
Introduction and Coaching Business Overview Mansour Manci introduced their new engineering career coaching business, which they started about a month and a half ago, focusing on process and materials. Mansour Manci is offering the coaching for free to friends and network contacts, including Ethan Swagger who was referred by CamL, with the main goal of receiving feedback and assessing the usefulness of the material (00:00:00). Mansour Manci emphasized that the purpose of the call was to ensure they could actually help Ethan Swagger with their career goals (00:00:54).
Ethan Swagger's Career Background and Goals Ethan Swagger, who has an Information Technology background but no degree, started working with computers at a young age, leading to a job at Geek Squad and later as an IT specialist at Casey's General Stores. Ethan Swagger highlighted that their time at Come and Go Maverick was a significant opportunity due to its family-oriented nature and the encouragement to grow their skillset, where they met CamL (00:00:54). Ethan Swagger is currently specializing in networking, studying for the CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification, which they plan to take in February (00:02:44).
Current Job Search and Obstacles Ethan Swagger confirmed they are currently between jobs and seeking roles in IT networking, with "network architect" being a dream job, while actively interviewing for network engineering positions (00:03:46). Ethan Swagger has been unemployed for under a month and suggested that potential roadblocks include the demand for more than just a CCNA certification, such as the CCNP, and possibly the lack of a four-year degree, which can be a hurdle due to AI recruitment processes (00:05:32). Ethan Swagger also noted that they have received job offers, but they were not optimal for their current career stage, as they are looking to move quickly from help desk to engineering (00:06:29).
Communication and Program Alignment Mansour Manci assessed Ethan Swagger's communication skills as seemingly strong, a fair representation, which Ethan Swagger attributed to extensive experience in customer service and learning from their team lead and manager, Adam Hulcom (00:07:21). Mansour Manci expressed confidence that the coaching program could benefit Ethan Swagger despite their IT background being outside Mansour Manci's usual engineering audience, and that Ethan Swagger's diverse background would help test the program's robustness (00:09:04). Ethan Swagger confirmed that behavioral-based interviews, which are the focus of Mansour Manci's coaching, are common in the IT world, similar to engineering roles (00:12:45).
Coaching Program Structure and Schedule Mansour Manci's program consists of three 90-minute sessions, with material provided before and after each session. Session one focuses on resume concepts and effectively extracting and presenting experiences to stand out (00:09:57) (00:11:50). Session two covers interview strategy and story mastery, specifically for behavioral-based interviews, while technical preparation is left to other resources (00:11:50) (00:13:40). Session three is a 90-minute live mock interview with detailed feedback provided after each answer to improve scoring (00:14:32). Mansour Manci suggested scheduling one session per week to maintain accountability and momentum (00:16:23).
Agreement and Logistics Ethan Swagger agreed to participate in the program, finding it a great opportunity to help Mansour Manci develop the material and allow them to "pick their brain". They scheduled the first 90-minute session for the following Tuesday evening, with Mansour Manci noting they are in the same time zone (Central Standard Time) and located in the Quad Cities area (00:15:29) (00:17:15). Mansour Manci confirmed that they also aim to secure a testimonial from Ethan Swagger if the experience is deemed valuable and asked if they would be comfortable with the content being used for promotional materials like a quick TikTok video, to which Ethan Swagger agreed (00:19:43).

Suggested next steps
Mansour Manci will send a calendar invite to Ethan Swagger for the first session on Tuesday the 20th and an email with welcoming, a packet of information, and some links.
