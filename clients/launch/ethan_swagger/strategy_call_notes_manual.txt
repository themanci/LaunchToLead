What's the dream role you're trying to land?

Why now? What happens if nothing changes in the next 6 months?
I am in-between jobs due to acquisitions and layoffs. If nothing changes in 6 months I will be a retail engineer.

Are you ready to invest $1,997 (or 3x$699) and 21 days to fix this?
No.

Background:
IT work.  No degree.  Started off as building PCs (ages 11-13), came to a point where I needed a job I liked.  Started with Geek Squad in Lincoln, NE.  Specialized in Networking now and learned a lot in last 2 years.  Studying for the CCA (Cisco certified associate), certification to test out provided by Cisco.

Major
No College

Goal:
Land a full time job in IT Networking.  Interviewing for a network engineering position.

Noticed big roadblock/issue:
Because looking for network engineering, they might want next step after CCA, which is CCP.  Might want an AA or BS degree.
