Summary
Mansour Manci offered Osaid Samman a free, three-session career coaching program in exchange for detailed feedback, emphasizing the importance of negative critique, and suggested a written recommendation if Osaid Samman finds the program valuable. Osaid Samman, a recent computer engineering graduate currently seeking remote/hybrid roles such as infrastructure or software engineer, discussed their background, including an interest in project-based work, self-diagnosed roadblocks like a perceived lack of experience, and aspirations for dream companies like Cisco. Mansour Manci advised Osaid Samman to leverage their non-engineering leadership role as secretary of a student association for differentiation, and outlined the program's structure focusing on resume transformation, STAR interview preparation, and a final mock interview, while also inviting Osaid Samman to a free community resource.

Program Offering and Feedback Expectations Mansour Manci offered Osaid Samman a free career coaching program developed over eight years, aiming to help people at different stages of their careers (00:00:00). Mansour Manci specified that the only requirement for Osaid Samman's participation is to provide detailed feedback, emphasizing that negative feedback is more important than positive feedback for improving the process (00:01:14). If Osaid Samman finds the program valuable, a written recommendation will be sufficient compensation (00:01:59).
Osaid Samman's Background and Career Status Osaid Samman graduated with a degree in computer engineering in May 2025 and is currently unemployed, actively looking for meaningful full-time work (00:01:59). Osaid Samman is also engaged in freelance work, building a website for a client through a personal connection, which is expected to be completed by June (00:02:53). Osaid Samman selected computer engineering due to an interest in computers, having previously made video games before college (00:03:57).
Academic Interests and Roadblocks Osaid Samman enjoys project-based courses, citing a software development practices class (309) where they built an Android app, and also enjoys working in group team settings (00:04:47). Osaid Samman self-diagnosed the primary roadblocks to employment as a perceived lack of experience and an occasional need to communicate more effectively, sometimes requiring more time to think and be quicker to respond (00:05:48). Mansour Manci stressed that interviewing is a buildable skill, requiring practice and preparation, which Osaid Samman has not had for a full-time position (00:06:48).
Career Aspirations and Profile Assessment Osaid Samman's GPA of 3.33 is considered above the cutoff for most companies, and Mansour Manci does not anticipate it hurting their chances (00:08:27). Osaid Samman's dream roles are remote/hybrid computer engineering positions, including network engineer, IT, software engineer, or infrastructure roles, with infrastructure being the highest priority. Cisco was mentioned as a dream company (00:09:26).
Leveraging Non-Engineering Leadership Experience Mansour Manci advised Osaid Samman to highlight their experience as secretary of a student organization (a student association) on campus, as this volunteer experience is valuable leadership experience (00:10:45). Mansour Manci noted that this role, which Osaid Samman chose to do above and beyond their coursework, is better than no engineering-related experience and is more differentiating than the standard senior design team leader role that everyone takes (00:11:42).
Program Structure and Logistics The program will consist of three virtual sessions, starting the following Monday, at the same time as the current meeting (9:00 a.m. Central Standard Time) (00:01:59) (00:12:39). The first session will focus on "resume transformation," the second on developing stories for STAR interviews, and the third session will be a full live mock interview with detailed feedback (00:14:45). Mansour Manci will provide Osaid Samman with presession materials, including worksheets and links, as well as transcripts and recordings of all sessions (00:13:36).
Community Resource and Future Outreach Mansour Manci also informed Osaid Samman about a free School.com community they are building, designed for young engineers seeking jobs to connect, find mock interview partners, and access free content (00:16:39). Mansour Manci extended an offer for Osaid Samman's younger brother, who is also studying computer engineering, to reach out for assistance as well (00:17:26).

Suggested next steps
Mansour Manci will send an email with a summary of the call, notes, information about the first session, material to review, a couple of small homework assignments, and a link to a school.com community by the end of the day today.
Osaid Samman will bring a resume and a few other things mentioned in the email to the first session on Monday.
Osaid Samman will give specific and detailed feedback, including negative feedback, about the program and provide a written recommendation if Osaid Samman feels it was worth it.
