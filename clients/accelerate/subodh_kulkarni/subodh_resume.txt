Experience
Program Quality Engineer, John Deere Research and Development Center, USA.                             2017 – Present
    • Delivered successfully MY26 Large Combine program through EPDP by managing the quality of 8 customer-facing features successfully, viz. Embedded 32-bit software, Combine Auto Unload, Side Switch Module. Grain tank covers, Smart Data Capture Controller, USB Ca adapter, beacon and back up camera, and instructor seat.  
    • Represented quality dept. in factory leadership meetings, product councils, and product leader meetings, and core team meetings.
    • Managed quality tasks by directing and guiding nine other quality engineers, workflow, and schedule/timelines.
    • Published and highlighted any risk to the program, example of risks - CAU (combine auto unload) tells us when grain cart is full, so grain don’t get spilled. The bracket for the camera position needs to be placed correctly to not miss the view and prevent unloading auger spilling the grain out of cart. Risk is minimized by adding a CVML camera for mistake proofing in the shop for the bracket position. High risk number was eliminated. 
    • Made sure that defects (NCCAs/CARs) were not repeated year to year – reduced repeat issues by 70% year to year and made sure that new defects were fixed and delivered year to year, Fixed 80+ new NCCAs/issues and ~ 1400 field events by working with cross functional teams at HX and ISG. Estimate is that 20%+ increase in customer productivity with the automation features achieved via working through the issues.
    • Delivered a MY25 Yield 3.0, a yield monitoring project through all EDDP and applied System Engineering approach for better thought processes from cross functions.
        ◦ Represented quality dept. in factory leadership meetings, product councils, product leader meetings, and core team meetings.
        ◦ Managed quality tasks by working with 3 other quality engineers, managed workflow, and schedule/timelines.
        ◦ Published and highlighted any risk to the program, example of risks – breaking of the senor support bracket. Worked with cross functional team to get the stiffening of the bracket by going through rigorous design and test processes. Another risk - accuracy of the yield measurement – it is ongoing process.  
        ◦ Made sure that defects (NCCAs/CARs) were not repeated year to year – reduced repeat issues by 90% year to year and made sure that new defects were fixed and delivered year to year, Fixed 30+ new NCCAs/issues and ~ 200 field events by collaborating with cross functional teams at HX and ISG. 
    • Led multiple LPB Wire Harness Integration programs from quality perspectives for large combines and FEE.
        ◦ Represented quality dept. in product leader meetings, and CDT meetings.
        ◦ Managed quality risks by collaborating with cross functional team, published and highlighted any risk to the program, example of risks – intermittently working ethernet cables, intermittently working FLP harnesses, missing wires in the transmission harness. To mitigate these risks, collaborated with suppliers and design engineers and got these issues corrected before 80 plus machines went beyond factory premises saving field issues.
        ◦ Established VB for wire-harnesses program for the first time and proactively segregated ten current product issues and influenced without authority to address then before builds. 
        ◦ Made sure that defects (NCCAs/CARs) were not repeated year to year – reduced repeat issues by 50% and made sure that new defects were fixed before the machines are delivered to dealers. Fixed 200+ new NCCAs/issues and ~ 500 field events by collaborating with cross functional teams at HX and ISG. 
    • Led Sensor and electrical components Integration programs from quality perspectives for a large combine machine (Grizzly) and FEE (Caribou) program.
        ◦ Represented quality dept. in product leader meetings, and CDT meetings.
        ◦ Published and highlighted any risk to the program, example of risks – breaking of the senor wires, melting of the circuits due to overheat, water intrusions in the lights, etc.  Drove actions for rigorous JDQ testing and worked across unis for those. Visited other units as well for information sharing.
        ◦ Made sure that defects (NCCAs/CARs) were not repeated year to year – reduced repeat issues by 90% year to year and made sure that new defects were fixed and delivered year to year, fixed 150+ new NCCAs/issues and ~ 100+ field events by collaborating with cross functional teams at HX and ISG. 
        ◦ Analyzed warranty data and drove intentional testing and corrective actions to close identified gaps from 126 Sensor application reviews for speed, temperature, pressure, proximity, position sensors on the combine for feasibility, durability, and limited production builds. Teams involved suppliers and cross-functional members and improved the quality of sensor we received.
        ◦ Underwent ESPA training at Fargo and got familiar with JDS – G194 and G156 standards and other processes and used that training to collaborate with suppliers to educate them.
        ◦ Managed a quality assurance project for 135 assemblies for a large combine program.   
        ◦ Initiated combining the redundant quality review procedures in a single meeting to save time; resulted in reduction in 150+ engineering hours for electrical system department and was adopted by other teams. 
        ◦ 250 + parts were processed for uncompromised qualitative, tactical, and strategic activities involving Quality Planning, Sensor Application Reviews, Non-Conformance management (NCCA), System and Process Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEAs), design and process assembly reviews (DPARs), Production part approval process (PPAPS). 
        ◦ Combined FGR and DPAR meetings saving at least 200 engineering hours and supplier’s time, increased efficiency by 20 percent in workflow management. The process change was later encouraged by the Global Quality manager to all other team members.
    • Led Durability Build activities, Feasibility Build Activities for Mercury Program, Caribou Flex Knife Fabrication (weld) fixture qualification, part ISIRs, repairs, and CI, where I was able to reduce 75% rework on frames amounting to 30 hours of rework per week and created DTAC solution. Piloted automated data collection on quality parameters and checks.
