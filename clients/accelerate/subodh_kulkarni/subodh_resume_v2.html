                <span class="sub-role-title">Program Quality Engineer, R&D Center</span>
                <span class="sub-role-dates">2017 – Present</span>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Led end-to-end quality delivery for the MY26 Large Combine program across 8 customer-facing features (embedded 32-bit software, Combine Auto Unload, Smart Data Capture Controller, and 5 others), managing 9 quality engineers through all EPDP gates to on-time release.</li>

                <li>Reduced repeat defects (NCCAs/CARs) by 70% year-over-year on the MY26 program by implementing systematic root cause tracking, resolving 80+ new nonconformances and closing ~1,400 field events across cross-functional teams at HX and ISG — contributing to an estimated 20%+ improvement in customer productivity through automation features.</li>

                <li>Delivered the MY25 Yield 3.0 yield monitoring program using a Systems Engineering approach, achieving 90% repeat defect reduction and resolving 30+ NCCAs and ~200 field events while coordinating with 3 quality engineers across factory leadership, product council, and core team reviews.</li>

                <li>Eliminated pre-delivery wire harness failures across 80+ machines by collaborating with suppliers and design engineers to identify and correct intermittent Ethernet cable, FLP harness, and transmission harness defects before units left the factory. Resolved 200+ NCCAs and ~500 field events; reduced repeat issues by 50%.</li>

                <li>Established the first-ever Verification Build (VB) process for wire harness programs, proactively segregating 10 current-product issues and influencing cross-functional teams without direct authority to remediate them before production builds.</li>

                <li>Drove quality for sensor and electrical component integration on the Grizzly combine and Caribou FEE program. Completed 126 sensor application reviews (speed, temperature, pressure, proximity, position) and managed quality assurance for 135 assemblies and 250+ parts across FMEA, DPAR, PPAP, and NCCA processes — reducing repeat issues by 90%.</li>

                <li>Saved 350+ engineering hours by consolidating redundant FGR and DPAR review meetings into a unified process, later adopted globally at the direction of the Global Quality Manager.</li>

                <li>Reduced frame rework by 75% on durability build activities (equivalent to 30 hours/week saved) and created a DTAC solution. Piloted automated data collection for quality parameters on the Mercury program.</li>

                <li>Identified and escalated program risks with quantified impact — including camera bracket positioning for Combine Auto Unload (resolved via CVML mistake-proofing) and sensor bracket failures on Yield 3.0 (resolved through cross-functional redesign and rigorous test validation).</li>

                <li>Led a team of 35 line inspectors across multiple shifts, managing qualification, staffing, scheduling, and performance — reducing absenteeism by ~20% through clear expectations and accountability measures.</li>

                <li>Implemented 100% cross-training of Combine and FEE line inspectors for the first time in HX history, eliminating overtime violations and saving ~$30,000 per year during multi-shift factory operations.</li>

                <li>Resolved the top 5 warranty issues on combines, eliminating 50% of associated defects by driving corrective actions across suppliers and cross-functional stakeholders — including 80% ladder damage reduction, auger engagement improvements, hydraulic valve leak elimination, and rear axle motor spindle failure prevention.</li>

                <li>Revised HX work instructions for nonconforming material processes and timelines, standardizing quality response across the factory.</li>
