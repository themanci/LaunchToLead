## Key Insights from Career Launch Call

### The Core Problem
- **Stuck as Senior Quality Engineer** - wants to become Engineering Manager
- Has been passed over despite being the most technically sound person in the room
- Strong technical skills, but struggles with "soft" influence and buy-in

### Specific Examples

1. **Electric Hydrogen (Current):** Expert on FMEA, said it wasn't the right time to implement. A less technical colleague (better at discussions) pushed for immediate implementation. VP sided with other guy, but Asjad has to drive it.

2. **BETA Technologies:** Fought hard for "Director of Quality" title while managing 8-10 people and driving all activities. After much back and forth, was denied and told he was "too young." Left the company.

### Communication Challenge
- **Work topics:** Talks easily and well
- **Personal/non-work topics:** Becomes awkward, struggles to build rapport
- Wants role-playing exercises to practice this

### Feedback Received
- Every company acknowledged his **strong technical skills**
- But consistently struggles to get **buy-in from decision-makers**
- Not able to "play the game" politically

## Personal

- **Family:** 3 kids
  - Oldest boy (4.5 years old)
  - Girl/boy twins (2.5 years old)
- **Location:** Greater Boston area

## Coaching Priorities

Based on Career Launch Call, focus areas for Accelerate Path:

1. **Visibility & Influence** - Stop being the invisible expert
2. **Stakeholder Buy-In** - Get decision-makers to support his ideas
3. **Personal Connection Building** - Improve non-work rapport with leaders
4. **Role-Playing Practice** - Mock conversations for difficult situations
5. **Manager vs. Technical Track** - Navigate the "titles don't matter at startups" pushback

---

## Notes for Tailoring

- **Manufacturing/Quality background** - Use factory floor analogies
- **FMEA expert** - He understands process analysis; can frame visibility as "failure mode prevention" for careers
- **Startup experience** - Familiar with "flat hierarchy" excuses; needs strategies to navigate this
- **ISU connection** - We both worked at Iowa State in 2014 (rapport builder)
