            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Payment Terms</h3>

                <strong>Pricing:</strong> Current pricing is discussed during your free strategy session. We offer flexible payment options including pay-in-full and installment plans.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                <strong>Strategy Session:</strong> Before purchasing any package, you'll have a free 15-minute strategy session to discuss your goals and answer any questions about pricing and payment.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Cancellation & Rescheduling Policy</h3>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                <strong>Client Cancellations:</strong> You may cancel or reschedule a session with at least 24 hours advance notice without penalty. Cancellations with less than 24 hours notice will be considered a completed session and no refund or rescheduling will be provided.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                <strong>No-Shows:</strong> If you miss a scheduled session without prior notice, it will be counted as a completed session.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                <strong>Coach Cancellations:</strong> If I need to cancel or reschedule due to illness, emergency, or other unforeseen circumstances, I'll provide as much notice as possible and work with you to reschedule at no additional cost.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                All materials provided during coaching sessions (templates, frameworks, examples, documents, resources) remain the intellectual property of Launch to Lead Engineering. You are granted a personal, non-transferable license to use these materials for your own career development only. You may not share, sell, reproduce, or distribute these materials to others.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                I respect your privacy and will keep all information shared during our coaching sessions confidential. However, confidentiality has limits:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Information may be shared if required by law or legal process</li>
                <li>Anonymized examples may be used in marketing materials or success stories (with your explicit permission only)</li>
                <li>I reserve the right to seek professional consultation or supervision while maintaining your anonymity</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. No Guarantee of Outcomes</h3>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                While I'm committed to providing strategic guidance, proven frameworks, and dedicated support, I cannot and do not guarantee specific career outcomes such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4 space-y-2">
                <li>Job offers from specific companies</li>
                <li>Salary increases or promotion timelines</li>
                <li>Interview success rates</li>
                <li>Hiring decisions made by employers</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-600 mb-4">
                Your success depends on multiple factors including your effort, market conditions, employer decisions, economic factors, and circumstances outside my control. Coaching provides strategies and support—results depend on your implementation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Limitation of Liability</h3>

                Our maximum liability to you for any claims related to our services shall not exceed the amount you paid for the specific package in question.
            </p>

                <li>It becomes clear that coaching is not a good fit</li>
