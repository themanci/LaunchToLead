## FEATURED ITEM #1: Lead Magnet / Free Resource

### Title:
**FREE: The Impact Equation Quick-Start Guide**

### Description (for LinkedIn post that links to it):
```
🎯 Your resume bullets are probably costing you interviews.

Here's why:

Most engineers write bullets like this:
❌ "Maintained spreadsheets for test results"

That's a TASK. Not an IMPACT.

Hiring managers see 500 of these. They blur together.

The fix? The Impact Equation:

[Accomplishment] + [Evidence/Metric] + [How] + [Why It Matters]

Same experience, transformed:
✅ "Solely managed data for 3 major programs across a 10-person team. Wrote a custom Python script touching the Azure DevOps API to automate tracking—cutting maintenance time by 85% and enabling daily executive reporting."

One tells them what you did.
The other tells them what you're WORTH.

I put together a free quick-start guide that walks you through exactly how to transform your bullets.

## FEATURED ITEM #2: Case Study / Proof Post

### Title:
**How I Got 4 Promotions in 7 Years (The System)**

How I Got 4 Promotions in 7 Years at a Fortune 100

(Without being the smartest coder in the room)

---

In 2018, I started at John Deere as a Mechanical Development Engineer.

By 2025, I was leading enterprise initiatives impacting 2,000+ engineers globally.

4 promotions. 3 major pivots. 7 years.

Here's exactly how I did it—and why most engineers get stuck.

---

THE PROBLEM

Universities teach you to calculate.
They don't teach you to navigate.

So you:
- Work hard
- Hit your deadlines
- Hope your boss notices
- Watch others get promoted

Sound familiar?

I was stuck there too. Until I realized:

Performance is not the differentiator.
Performance is the ENTRY FEE.

THE SYSTEM I BUILT

I started treating my career like an engineering problem:
- Identify the variables (Visibility, Impact, Sponsorship)
- Optimize the constraints
- Solve for X (Velocity)

Here's what I learned:

**1. THE IMPACT EQUATION**

Stop listing tasks. Start proving value.

Old: "Maintained spreadsheets"
New: "Automated tracking for 3 programs, cutting time by 85%, enabling daily executive visibility"

Same work. Different story. Different outcome.

**2. THE VISIBILITY PYRAMID**

Being good is Level 1.
Being known for being good is Level 4.

I made sure my skip-level (my boss's boss) knew my name.
How? Volunteered for the demo. Sent the summary email that got forwarded up.

If your boss gets hit by a bus, does the VP know your name?
If not, you're invisible.

**3. THE TROJAN HORSE**

I wanted to pivot from Mechanical to Software.
But I had zero software experience.

So I didn't ASK for a software project.
I TOOK a Mechanical problem and solved it with Software.

I automated my own job. Then showed the software team what I built.

Old Problem + New Tool = Pivot Portfolio.

**4. THE SERVICE-BASED ASK**

When I wanted promotion, I never said "I want more money."

I said: "I feel I've mastered my current scope. I'm looking for more responsibility so I can solve [Bigger Problem] for the team. What does the gap look like?"

This shifts the conversation from GREED to GROWTH.

THE RESULTS

📈 4 Promotions in 7 years
🔄 3 Major Pivots (Civil → Mechanical → Software → Leadership)
🚀 Currently impacting 2,000+ engineers
💰 Delivered $1B+ in programs to market
🏆 Direct recognition from department directors

---

THE LESSON

Your career is an engineering problem.

Most people hope and wait.
Engineers identify variables and optimize.

I built a system. It worked for me.
Now I teach it to other engineers.

## BONUS: Featured Post Ideas (High Engagement)

### Post Idea 1: "The Interview Pause"
```
The most confident thing you can do in an interview:

"That's a great question. Can I take a moment to think?"

Why it works:
- Shows you're thoughtful, not reactive
- Proves confidence, not nervousness
- Gives you time to find your BEST example

The interviewer isn't timing you.
They're evaluating you.

Rushed answers sound desperate.
Paused answers sound executive.

Try it next time.

```

### Post Idea 2: "The Boring to Booming Transformation"
```
Your resume bullet: "Maintained spreadsheets for test results."

My reaction: 😴

Let me fix that in 30 seconds:

"Solely managed data for 3 major programs across a 10-person team, handling 100 daily tests. Wrote a custom Python script touching the Azure DevOps API to automate tracking, cutting maintenance time by 85% and enabling daily executive reporting."

Same experience.
Completely different impression.

The formula:
[What you did] + [Scale/Metric] + [How] + [Why it matters]

I call it The Impact Equation.

Your resume is not a job description.
It's a highlight reel.

Write like it.

#resume #engineering #jobsearch #careeradvice
```

### Post Idea 3: "The Application Black Hole"
```
You've applied to 50 jobs.
You've heard back from 2.
Both were rejections.

Welcome to the Application Black Hole.

Here's why it happens:

1. Your bullets read like job descriptions (boring)
2. Your resume uses YOUR industry jargon (confusing)
3. You're competing with 500 other "did the job" resumes

The fix isn't applying MORE.
The fix is applying BETTER.

I went from 5% callback rate to 40% using 3 changes:
→ Impact Equation (outcomes, not tasks)
→ Universal Translator (remove jargon)
→ Pattern Interrupt (confidence, not desperation)

Stop spraying and praying.
Start engineering your applications.
