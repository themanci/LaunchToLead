                    <p>I got 4 promotions in 7 years.</p>
                    <p>Here's what nobody tells you about climbing the engineering ladder:</p>
                    <p>It wasn't because I was the smartest person in the room.<br>
                    It wasn't because I worked 80-hour weeks.<br>
                    It wasn't luck.</p>
                    <p>It was because I learned to:</p>
                    <p>→ Build visibility without being pushy<br>
                    → Document impact in a way leadership actually cares about<br>
                    → Navigate internal politics without playing games<br>
                    → Ask for promotions strategically (timing is everything)</p>
                    <p>I went from mechanical engineer → software engineer → team lead → engineering manager.</p>
                    <p>Each transition taught me something crucial about career growth that they don't teach in engineering school.</p>
                    <p>Now I'm coaching engineers who feel stuck, overlooked, or ready to pivot their careers.</p>
                    <p>Because the technical skills got you here. But they won't get you there.</p>

                    <p>I remember sitting in my mechanical engineering cubicle in 2017, watching software engineers work.</p>
                    <p>They had flexibility. Remote options. Higher salaries. More interesting problems.</p>
                    <p>I had... CAD files and manufacturing specs.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to pivot. But I had no idea where to start.</p>

                    <p>Fast forward 8 years:</p>
                    <p>✅ Mechanical → Software Engineer<br>
                    ✅ 4 promotions<br>
                    ✅ Built and led engineering teams<br>
                    ✅ Helped dozens of engineers navigate similar transitions</p>

                    <p>Promotions go to engineers who:</p>
                    <p>✓ Make their impact visible (not just to their manager, but 2-3 levels up)<br>

                    ✓ Document wins in business terms (not just technical achievements)<br>

                    <p>5 things I wish I knew before my first engineering promotion:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Your manager isn't tracking your wins</strong><br>
                    You are. Document every major project, problem solved, and impact delivered. Your promo packet writes itself if you track as you go.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Promotions happen before they're announced</strong><br>
                    By the time your manager says "we're considering promotions," the decisions are 80% made. Build visibility early.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Cross-team impact > solo technical brilliance</strong><br>
                    Solving hard problems alone gets you recognized by your team. Solving problems that help other teams gets you promoted.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Timing matters more than you think</strong><br>
                    Asking for a promotion right after budget cuts, reorgs, or your manager's rough quarter? Bad timing. Learn the cycle.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. "Just work hard" is terrible advice</strong><br>
                    I know engineers who work 60-hour weeks and stay at the same level for years. Strategy > effort.</p>
                    <p>It took me 2 years to learn these lessons.</p>
                    <p>Now I help engineers skip the trial-and-error phase.</p>

                    <p>I'll never forget the promotion I didn't get.</p>
                    <p>2016. I'd been with the company for 2 years. Put in the work. Hit my goals. Thought I was a shoe-in.</p>
                    <p>The promotion went to someone else.</p>
                    <p>When I asked my manager why, he said: "You're doing great work. We just need to see more leadership."</p>
                    <p>I had no idea what that meant.</p>
                    <p>More meetings? Speak up more? Work harder?</p>
                    <p>That moment changed everything for me.</p>
                    <p>I realized: Being good at your job is not enough.</p>
                    <p>I started studying promotions like I studied engineering problems:</p>
                    <p>→ What do promoted engineers do differently?<br>
                    → How do they build visibility?<br>
                    → What language do they use?<br>
                    → How do they position their impact?</p>
                    <p>12 months later, I got promoted.</p>
                    <p>Then again. And again. And again.</p>
                    <p>4 promotions in 7 years.</p>
                    <p>Not because I became a better coder. Because I learned the invisible playbook.</p>
                    <p>Now I'm launching Launch to Lead Engineering to teach that playbook to other engineers.</p>
                    <p>If you've ever been passed over and wondered "what am I missing?"</p>
                    <p>You're not missing talent. You're missing strategy.</p>

                    <p>Unpopular opinion:</p>
                    <p>Your engineering degree won't get you promoted.</p>
                    <p>Your technical skills won't either.</p>
                    <p>Your soft skills will.</p>
                    <p>I know, I know. We became engineers because we liked problems more than people.</p>
                    <p>But here's the harsh truth:</p>
                    <p>The engineer who gets promoted isn't always the best coder.</p>
                    <p>It's the engineer who:</p>
                    <p>✓ Communicates impact in business terms<br>
                    ✓ Builds relationships across teams<br>
                    ✓ Navigates politics without being political<br>
                    ✓ Makes others look good (especially upward)<br>
                    ✓ Knows when to speak up and when to listen</p>
                    <p>I've seen brilliant engineers stuck at mid-level for years because they only focused on code.</p>
                    <p>And I've seen average coders become VPs because they mastered the human side of engineering.</p>
                    <p>The good news? These are learnable skills.</p>
                    <p>I went from introverted mechanical engineer to engineering manager by learning them deliberately.</p>
                    <p>Now I'm teaching them at Launch to Lead Engineering 🚀</p>
                    <p>Because technical excellence is table stakes.</p>
                    <p>Career strategy is what separates the stuck from the climbing.</p>

                    <p>Quick question for engineers:</p>
                    <p>How long have you been at your current level?</p>
                    <p>📍 Less than 1 year<br>
                    📍 1-2 years<br>
                    📍 3-4 years<br>
                    📍 5+ years</p>
                    <p>If you said 3+ years, this is for you.</p>
                    <p>Here's what I've learned from my own career and coaching dozens of engineers:</p>
                    <p>If you've been at the same level for more than 2-3 years, one of three things is happening:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. You're not making your impact visible</strong><br>
                    Your manager (and their manager) don't fully understand what you deliver.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. You're stuck in "do your job well" mode</strong><br>
                    Promotions require operating at the next level before you get the title.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. You don't have a promotion strategy</strong><br>
                    You're waiting for someone to notice you. They won't.</p>
                    <p>The good news? All three are fixable with the right approach.</p>
                    <p>I went from mechanical engineer to engineering manager in 7 years (4 promotions).</p>
                    <p>Not because I was the smartest. Because I learned the system.</p>
                    <p>Now I'm launching Launch to Lead Engineering to help others do the same.</p>
                    <p>If you're tired of being stuck, let's change that. 🚀</p>
