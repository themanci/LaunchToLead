            <div class="post-content">Updating your resume shouldn't take 4 hours.

But most people stare at a blank document trying to remember everything they've done in the last 2 years.

Here's a hack I've been using:

Don't type. Talk.

Open any voice-to-text app (Windows has one built in, or use your phone). Hit record. Then just ramble for 10 minutes:

"So at my last job, I worked on this thermal testing project where we had to figure out why the heat exchanger was failing. I redesigned the test fixture and..."

Don't worry about structure. Don't worry about bullet points. Just talk like you're telling a friend what you've been up to.

Now paste that mess into ChatGPT and ask it to:
• Identify distinct projects or accomplishments
• Ask you follow-up questions to get more detail
• Tell you which ones are most relevant for a specific job posting

This is how AI should be used. As a sidekick. Not to write your resume for you—but to help you pull out what's already in your head.

Because the projects are in there. You lived them. You just forgot how to articulate them.

AI helps you remember. Then YOU decide what goes on the resume.

Don't outsource your brain. Use AI to unlock it.

        <h3>Core Message: AI as Sidekick</h3>
        <p>
            This post reinforces your brand positioning that AI should <strong>assist</strong> not <strong>replace</strong> human thinking. 
            The brain dump → voice transcription → AI sorting workflow shows a practical "sidekick" use case that's actually useful, 
            while making clear that the human still makes the final decisions about what matters.

            <li><strong>Best time:</strong> Tuesday-Thursday, 7-8am or 12pm your timezone</li>
            <li><strong>Engage immediately:</strong> Reply to every comment in the first hour</li>
            <li><strong>Add a comment:</strong> Drop a follow-up like "What's your favorite voice-to-text app? I use the Windows one but curious what others work well."</li>
            <li><strong>No link in post:</strong> LinkedIn suppresses posts with external links—keep it clean</li>
            <li><strong>Personal story option:</strong> Consider starting with "I just helped a client update a 2-year-old resume in 45 minutes using this" for social proof</li>
            <li><strong>Controversial angle:</strong> The "don't outsource your brain" line is slightly contrarian to the "let AI do everything" crowd—expect some debate, which is good for engagement</li>
