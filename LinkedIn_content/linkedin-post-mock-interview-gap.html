            <div class="post-content">Most people do 1 mock interview before the real thing.

That's like doing 1 practice rep before the Olympics.

Here's what I've noticed after coaching dozens of engineers:

Everyone thinks they're a better interviewer than they are.

They know their projects inside and out. They assume that means they can talk about them clearly under pressure.

They can't.

The first mock interview is usually rough. Rambling. Missing key details. Running out of time. Freezing on "negative" questions.

By mock interview 5? Completely different person.

The answers are tighter. The confidence is real. The examples flow like muscle memory.

Interviewing is a skill. It improves with reps.

The problem is most people don't get enough reps before it counts.

Find anyone—friend, classmate, family member, coworker. Ask them to sit across from you for 30 minutes with a list of behavioral questions from Google.

It doesn't matter if they're not in your field. You'll still learn:
• Are you rambling?
• Are you clear?
• Did you actually answer the question?

Do that 5-7 times before your next interview.

You'll walk in feeling like you've already done this before.

Because you have.
