                <p class="text-sm text-indigo-800">
                    <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Murilo was a senior engineer seeking promotion and leadership advancement. He had technical expertise but needed visibility building, relationship cultivation, and strategic positioning for promotion opportunities. He successfully implemented the Trojan Horse strategy (managing a technician before official promotion), which is a core Accelerate method.

                    While Accelerate is primary, there's a minor Pivot element (positioning for deeper software technical role). However, the dominant challenge was promotion/visibility, not discipline transition.

                        Murilo was a senior engineer at John Deere with strong technical knowledge and drive, but he was struggling to position himself for promotion and transition deeper into software. He had the ambition to move from design into the software area but lacked technical direction and confidence to make that change effectively. This created a sense of stagnation—he knew he had potential to contribute more strategically but wasn't sure how to bridge the gap between where he was and where he wanted to be.

This framework gave me clarity, direction, and confidence, and made the transition feel achievable rather than overwhelming."

                        Through our Accelerate coaching, Murilo learned to build visibility, cultivate strategic relationships that would pay off in 6-12 months, and leverage the Trojan Horse strategy. He convinced his manager to assign him a technician to direct, giving him real management experience and proof of leadership capability before getting the official promotion. This created undeniable evidence he was ready for the next level.
