                    <strong>Reasoning:</strong> AJ was an entry-level engineer seeking promotion to Level 2. His challenges were classic Accelerate territory: taking ownership, building visibility, leading initiatives without formal authority, and using the Trojan Horse strategy (taking over an entire product line before getting promoted). He achieved his promotion in ~18 months through strategic positioning and leadership demonstration.

He wasn't set up for success with his workload, and the constant uncertainty was pushing him to question whether he even wanted to stay. He needed to develop ownership, accountability, and the skills to rise above the noise.

                        Through our Accelerate coaching, AJ learned that hard work alone wasn't enough—he needed to make his impact visible. He used the Trojan Horse method, stepping up to own an entire product line before being promoted. He learned to influence without authority, communicate effectively with skip-level managers, and bring forward ideas that earned recognition.
