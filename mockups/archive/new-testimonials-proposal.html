                            Cole felt stuck in his career with limited opportunities for advancement.

                            Through our Accelerate coaching, Cole learned that promotion readiness goes far beyond technical excellence. We focused on strategic positioning, building relationships with key stakeholders, and developing interviewing skills for when opportunities emerged. The coaching was honest and specific—not generic career advice, but tailored strategies for his exact role and aspirations at John Deere.

He felt lost and knew that getting coaching would help him overcome barriers faster and achieve his summer goals more effectively.

                            Through our Launch coaching, Ebuka learned to think beyond just securing a single return offer. We covered Launch framework fundamentals: networking authentically, building relationships with his manager and peers, maximizing his intern project impact, and—most importantly—thinking broadly about his career path. The coaching was raw and genuine, digging deeper before giving advice rather than offering surface-level platitudes.
