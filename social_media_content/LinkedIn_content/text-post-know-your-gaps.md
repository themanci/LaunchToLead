# LinkedIn Post: Know Your Gaps Before You Get a Coach

## Post Text

I was talking with a friend who's spent 10 years coaching engineers at Amazon and Microsoft.

We both noticed the same pattern:

Someone reaches out asking for coaching. They say they're "stuck" or "hitting a ceiling."

Then you ask: "What do you think your biggest gaps are?"

Silence. Crickets.

They know something's wrong. They just haven't figured out what.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

𝗜𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻'𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗰𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗴𝗮𝗽𝘀, 𝘆𝗼𝘂'𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝘁 𝘇𝗲𝗿𝗼. 𝗬𝗼𝘂'𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲.

You're below the starting line.

A coach can't help you if you don't know what you need help with.

So before you seek a mentor or coach, do the work:

→ What feedback keeps showing up in your reviews?
→ What do managers consistently tell you to improve?
→ What patterns do you see across multiple jobs?

If you're not getting feedback—that's a problem too. Push your manager for it. Ask directly: "What's one thing I should work on?"

Better yet, do a 360:
↳ Ask seniors what they'd improve
↳ Ask peers what they notice
↳ Ask juniors how you could support them better

Most people either:
• Never ask for feedback
• Dismiss feedback as "biased" or "unfair"
• Hear it but don't internalize it

The best coaching relationships start with self-awareness.

Know your gaps. Know where you want to grow. Know what's holding you back.

Then when you get that coach or mentor, you hit the ground running.

Don't show up empty-handed.
