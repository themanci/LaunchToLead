# Your Best Example Might Not Look "Technical"

**Topic:** Don't dismiss unconventional examples - they often demonstrate MORE depth than polished corporate stories

**Hook Options:**
1. "That's not a real engineering example." ← Wrong.
2. Your best interview story might come from a retail job.
3. Stop dismissing your "non-technical" examples.

Your best interview answer might come from a retail job.

Not a Fortune 500 project.
Not a technical presentation to executives.
Not your senior design capstone.

I was coaching someone yesterday on behavioral interview prep.

The question: "Tell me about a time you adapted your communication style for a different audience."

They hesitated.

"I have an example, but I don't think it counts. It's not really technical..."

The example?

Training a coworker on the autism spectrum at a previous job to complete a specific task.

I stopped them right there.

"That's one of the best examples I've heard."

Here's what most candidates get wrong:

They think "adapting communication for a non-technical audience" means:
→ Presenting your project to the marketing team
→ Explaining code to your manager
→ Dumbing down a concept for executives

Those are fine examples.

But training someone who genuinely processes information differently?

That demonstrates:
• Real empathy (not performative empathy)
• Genuine patience and observation
• Adapting WITHOUT being condescending
• Understanding someone's learning style
• Meeting people where they actually are
• Communication as a skill, not a checkbox

This example showed MORE competency than the typical "I presented my senior project to a non-technical panel."

Why?

Because it required them to:
- Observe how this person learned
- Adjust their approach in real-time
- Check for understanding without being patronizing
- Care about the outcome for the OTHER person

That's what communication and influence actually means.

Not "I can explain technical things simply."

But "I can connect with anyone, regardless of how they process information."

Stop dismissing your experiences.

The example you think is "too small" or "not technical enough"?

It might be the one that sets you apart.
