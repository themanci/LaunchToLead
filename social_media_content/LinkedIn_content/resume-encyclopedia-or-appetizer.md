Is your resume an encyclopedia or an appetizer?

Most people treat their resume like an autobiography — a comprehensive history of every job, project, and accomplishment they've ever had.

That's the wrong mindset.

Here's the truth:

Your resume has ONE job: get you an interview.

That's it. It's not there to tell your whole life story. It's there to make a hiring manager say "I want to talk to this person."

And here's what most people don't realize:

When you put everything on your resume, you're making the employer do the work.

They have to sift through 3 pages of your history to find the 5 things that are actually relevant to the role. Most of them won't. They'll move on to the next resume that was well thought out.

So what's the shift?

**Think of your resume as an appetizer, not an encyclopedia.**

An appetizer is curated. It's designed to make you want more. It gives you just enough to say "yes, I want the full meal."

Your resume should do the same thing.

Here's how to apply this:

**1. Only include what's relevant to the role you're applying for.**
Not every experience. Not every project. The ones that matter for THIS job.

**2. Order by relevance, not just chronology.**
Most relevant at the top. Least relevant at the bottom — or off the resume entirely.

**3. Make it easy for them.**
Don't make employers hunt for why you're qualified. Show them immediately.

The goal isn't to overwhelm them with your whole career.

The goal is to make them curious enough to pick up the phone.

That's what an appetizer does.

Your resume isn't a history book.

It's a highlight reel — curated for the specific role you want.

Make it easy for them to say yes.
