## LINKEDIN POST

Stop asking "What's the company culture like?"

That question tells the interviewer nothing about you — and tells you nothing useful about them.

Here are the 3 questions I coach every engineer to ask instead:

---

**1. "Are there any gaps in my qualifications that might make this role more challenging for me?"**

This question is uncomfortable. That's why it works.

You're giving them permission to voice concerns — and giving yourself a chance to address them before you leave the room.

Most candidates never get this chance. They walk out wondering what went wrong. You'll know exactly what's on their mind and have the opportunity to reframe it.

---

**2. "What does your onboarding or training process look like for someone new to the team?"**

This question does two things.

First, it signals that you're serious about ramping up and contributing — you're already thinking like an employee, not an applicant.

Second, it reveals a LOT about the company.

If they have a structured onboarding program, great — you'll know what to expect and that they invest in new hires. If they stumble or say "we kind of figure it out as we go," that's a red flag. You're either walking into chaos, or you'll be expected to sink or swim with no support.

Either way, you want to know before you accept the offer.

---

**3. "What tools, technologies, or systems will I be working with day-to-day?"**

This one is tactical.

It shows you're thinking practically about the work. It also gives you useful information — if they're using outdated tech or tools you've never touched, you'll know what to prepare for.

---

**Why only 3 questions?**

For a phone screen or first-round interview, 3 solid questions is enough.

You're not interrogating them. You're showing intentionality.

More than 3 and you risk running over time or coming across as difficult. Less than 3 and you seem unprepared.

---

**One more thing:**

Remember — your goal right now is to secure an offer.

Once they extend an offer, THAT'S when you can ask as many questions as you want. Leave no stone unturned. Grill them on culture, work-life balance, growth paths, whatever matters to you.

But you can't negotiate or ask tough questions from a position of strength until you have an offer in hand.

Get the offer first. There will always be more time to ask every question to your heart's content before you accept.

---

The next time someone asks "Do you have any questions for us?"

Don't ask about culture.
Don't ask about work-life balance.
Don't ask what they like about working there.

Ask questions that make them think: "This person is serious."

That's how you stand out.

## ALT CLOSING (If you want a softer CTA)

Bookmark this before your next interview.

And if you've got a killer question that's worked for you — drop it in the comments. I'm always looking for new ones to share with my clients.
