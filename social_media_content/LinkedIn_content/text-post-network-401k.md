# LinkedIn Post: Network Like a 401k

## Post Content

Your network is a 401k.

Not the boring HR presentation kind.

The "holy crap, compound interest is real" kind.

Here's what I mean:

**Year 1:** You meet 20 people. Nothing happens.

**Year 3:** A few coffee chats. Some LinkedIn connections. Still feels pointless.

**Year 5:** Someone you barely remember refers you for a job.

**Year 10:** You have an army.

People who:
→ Answer your random 11pm questions
→ Make introductions without being asked
→ Celebrate your wins like they're their own
→ Tell you the truth when you need to hear it

And the best part?

You get to BE that person for others.

The mentor you needed 10 years ago.
The connection who opens doors.
The friend who picks up on the first ring.

But here's the thing about compound growth:

**It only works if you start.**

Every coffee chat is a deposit.
Every genuine follow-up is interest earned.
Every "how can I help?" is reinvesting dividends.

Skip the deposits for 10 years?

You'll wonder why everyone else has this "network" thing figured out.

Start today?

10 years from now, you won't believe what you built.

And what you get to give.

That 20-minute coffee chat might not feel like much.

But neither did your first $50 into a retirement account.

Start planting. The harvest comes later.
