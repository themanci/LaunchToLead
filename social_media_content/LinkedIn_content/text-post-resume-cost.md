# LinkedIn Post: The Real Cost of a Bad Resume

---

**POST TEXT:**

Let's do some uncomfortable math.

The average entry-level engineering salary is around $80K. That's roughly $6,700/month.

Every month you spend job hunting with a resume that doesn't work?

That's $6,700 you're not earning.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you exactly how to fix your resume so you stop losing money. Link in comments.

3 months = $20,000
6 months = $40,000

I'm not saying this to stress you out. I'm saying it because I've worked with dozens of engineers who spent months applying to hundreds of jobs—only to realize the problem was never their experience.

It was how they presented it.

Here's what I see over and over:

Most engineering resumes read like job descriptions. Tasks listed. Responsibilities copied. Nothing that makes you stand out.

Hiring managers spend about 6 seconds on your resume before deciding. If it looks like everyone else's, you get filtered out—no matter how qualified you are.

---

The fix isn't complicated. It's about showing impact, not just activity.

Instead of "Developed software for manufacturing systems"—try:
"Built automated testing system that reduced defect rate by 34%, saving $120K annually"

Same job. Same experience. Completely different outcome.

---

One engineer I worked with went from zero callbacks to 4 offers in 90 days after making this shift.

Another went from anxious intern to a $106K offer at Ford.

They didn't suddenly gain more experience. They learned how to communicate what they'd already done.

---

If your resume isn't getting callbacks, it's probably not a "you" problem.

It's a presentation problem. And that's fixable.
