## LINKEDIN POST

A client asked me this week:

"Would it be okay at the end of an interview to ask the interviewers what the biggest mistake they've made in their career is?"

I get what they were going for. It's trying to be insightful. Trying to build rapport. Trying to show curiosity.

But here's the problem:

You're putting the interviewer on the hot seat.

And making someone uncomfortable in the final moments of an interview is not going to serve you well.

Here's the thing about "end of interview" questions:

You're not there to interview them. You're there to make them want to hire you.

Asking about their "biggest mistake" can feel sharp, intrusive, or like you're flipping the power dynamic in an uncomfortable way.

Even if they answer gracefully, there's a chance they walk away feeling put on the spot — and that feeling sticks.

**So what do you ask instead?**

Same intent. Softer delivery.

Try something like:

"You've been at the company for 15 years — what's one thing you wish someone had told you when you first started?"

This gets you the same kind of insight. Real talk about the company. Lessons learned.

But it feels like a conversation, not a challenge.

The best interview questions:
✓ Show genuine curiosity
✓ Make the interviewer feel good about answering
✓ Don't put anyone on the spot

You want them to leave the conversation thinking "I liked that person."

Not "That was... uncomfortable."
