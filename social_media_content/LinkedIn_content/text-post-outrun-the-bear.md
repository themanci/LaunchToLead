# LinkedIn Post: You Don't Have to Outrun the Bear

---

**POST TEXT:**

There's an old joke about being in the woods with friends when you stumble upon a bear and her cub.

The bear starts charging.

Your friend says, "We can't outrun a bear!"

You say, "I don't have to outrun the bear. I just have to outrun you."

Crude? Yes. But it paints an accurate picture for any difficult situation.

Including the engineering job market.

---

Here's the reality right now:

Fewer jobs. More applicants per role. Longer hiring cycles.

It's tough. I'm not going to pretend it isn't.

But here's what I've also seen:

People are still landing interviews. People are still getting offers.

I've coached multiple engineers this past month alone who have landed roles — in this market.

So what's the difference?

**You don't have to be the best engineer on earth.**

You don't need the perfect resume.
You don't need flawless interview examples.
You don't need to give the greatest interview performance of all time.

You just need to be putting in more effort than the average applicant.

That's it.

And in a market like this, "average effort" is surprisingly low.

Most people:
→ Send the same generic resume everywhere
→ Don't tailor their applications
→ Don't practice their interview answers out loud
→ Don't do any cold outreach or networking
→ Don't work on side projects to fill gaps
→ Don't invest time in learning how to sell themselves

The bar isn't as high as you think. You just have to clear it.

**Here's what "above average" actually looks like:**

✓ Spend real time on your resume — not 30 minutes, but hours
✓ Tailor your bullets to match the job description
✓ Network intentionally — not just "connecting," but building relationships
✓ Do cold outreach to hiring managers and engineers at target companies
✓ Prepare 8-10 strong interview examples using a framework like STAR
✓ Practice those examples out loud until they're second nature
✓ Work on independent projects that demonstrate initiative
✓ Learn how to communicate your value clearly and confidently

None of this is rocket science. It's just effort most people aren't willing to put in.

**You have two choices right now:**

**Option 1:** Throw your hands up. Say it's not fair. Complain about the market. Wait for things to get better.

**Option 2:** Decide to be better than the average applicant. Put in the work. Out-prepare your competition.

Throughout every difficult period in history — recessions, downturns, uncertainty — people still thrived. People still succeeded.

The question is: will that be you?

You don't have to outrun the bear.

You just have to outrun the people who gave up.
