If I could go back and give my college self ONE piece of advice, it would be this:

Master the art of focus.

Back then, social media was still young. We didn't have nearly as many distractions as today.

But we still found ways to avoid focus:

→ Going to the library with friends to "study" (terrible idea—so little actual work got done)
→ Keeping my phone with me while studying, checking it every 20 minutes
→ Pushing studying to nighttime when I was already exhausted and unfocused
→ Procrastinating schoolwork to grab lunch with a friend or hit the gym midday

Just so many ways to avoid focus.

Today, everyone wants a magic time hack.

There are endless productivity gurus promising secrets and systems.

But the reality is painfully simple:

Get rid of all distractions.
Go into a room.
Work focused for a chunk of time.

That's it.

And yes—it will be hard at first. Very hard.

You might actually focus LESS because your brain is screaming about all the things you could be doing instead.

But start small:

Don't try to go full Alex Hormozi and lock yourself in for 8 hours straight.

Start with 1 hour.
Bring something that tells time (NOT your phone).
Set a timer.
Just do it.

The first session might not be very productive. That's okay.

Then work your way up:
1 hour → 2 hours → 3 hours → 4 hours

4-hour chunks of undisturbed, fully focused work will change your life.

People wonder how others accomplish so much.

Yes, there's privilege. Connections. Doors being opened.

But plenty of people without those advantages have achieved incredible success.

The difference?

They are simply more focused.
More often.
More days.
More weeks.
More months.
Over years.

You can keep making excuses.

But deep down, you know they're just excuses because you're afraid to:
- Shut off your phone
- Shut off your music
- Disconnect from entertainment
- Give up that constant dopamine hit

And here's what nobody tells you:

Eventually, the focused sessions BECOME the dopamine hit.

That's when it gets dangerous (in the best way).

Imagine being as addicted to getting focused work done as you are to checking your phone every 3 minutes.

You would be unstoppable.
