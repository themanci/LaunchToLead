# LinkedIn Post: Be the Student They Remember

---

**POST TEXT:**

The power of your network cannot be overstated.

But most college students don't start building one until they need something. By then, it's too late.

Here's what I mean.

In university, I had a study group of 4 of us in a Physics class. We went to the professor's office hours consistently. Not once. Not twice. Every time they were available.

Before one exam, a friend in our group was struggling badly with one type of problem. Just could not get it. We kept going back for help, and the professor kept working through it with us.

After one session, the professor smiled and said:

"Look, these types of problems are important to learn because of X, Y, Z applications. But if I were you, I wouldn't worry too much about this type of problem for the exam."

Read that again.

The professor basically told us not to waste our time stressing over it. That problem wasn't going to be on the exam.

Now imagine my friend never went to office hours. Never introduced himself. Never built that relationship.

He would've spent the next week pouring hours into a problem type that didn't even show up. He would've stressed himself out and neglected the material that actually mattered.

Instead, he redirected that energy and crushed the exam.

Will every professor hand you a hint like that? No.

But that's the point.

Your network isn't about guarantees. It's about putting yourself in rooms where good things can happen. The more people who know you — really know you — the more doors that open in ways you never expected.

---

Here's what I'd tell every college student:

1. Sit in the front row. Every class. Every lecture hall. Be visible.

2. Introduce yourself to your professors. Not in a transactional way. In a genuine, human way.

3. Go to office hours. Go to help sessions. Go even when you don't have a question. Just show up.

4. Build a real relationship. Your professors should know you on a first-name basis.

These are people who have industry connections, write recommendation letters, and hear about job openings before they're posted. But they don't do those things for students they've never talked to.

They do it for the ones who showed up.

The power of your network cannot be overstated. Start building it now, while the cost of doing so is just showing up to a room you're already paying to be in.
