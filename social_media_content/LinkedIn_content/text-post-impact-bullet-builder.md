Your resume isn't getting rejected.
It's getting filtered out before a human ever sees it.

75% of engineering resumes are auto-rejected by ATS software. Not because you're unqualified — because your bullets don't speak the language these systems are scanning for.

Here's what I mean:

❌ "Worked on embedded firmware and helped debug communication issues between modules"

That tells a recruiter nothing. It's a job description, not a result.

Now watch what happens when you use the Impact Bullet formula:

✅ "Cut field failure rate by 62% by refactoring the CAN bus interrupt handler in C to implement priority-based arbitration across 8 ECUs on a safety-critical powertrain network"

Same person. Same experience. Completely different outcome.

The difference? One gets filtered. The other gets callbacks.

I used this exact framework to land my first engineering job at John Deere. My clients have used it to land at Google, SpaceX, Ford, GE, and Bridgestone.

So I packaged the whole system into a free 14-page guide:

The Impact Bullet Builder™

Inside you'll get:
→ The 4-part formula (Accomplishment + Metric + How + Why)
→ Real before/after examples from actual engineering resumes
→ A fill-in-the-blank worksheet to build your own bullets
→ The BS Meter — how to tell if your bullet is strong enough

Every month without a job costs you ~$6,700 in lost income.

A better resume is the fastest fix.
