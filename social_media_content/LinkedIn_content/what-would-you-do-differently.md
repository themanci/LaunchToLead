# What Would You Do Differently?

**Topic:** Prepare for the "what would you do differently" follow-up question—or better yet, answer it before it's asked

**Hook Options:**
1. "What would you do differently?" — Why does this question catch so many people off guard?
2. The most powerful thing you can do in an interview is answer a question before it's asked.
3. Stop waiting for them to ask. Tell them what you'd improve before they even think of it.

"What would you do differently if you could do it again?"

This is one of the most common follow-up questions after a behavioral interview answer.

And the number of people I've seen get caught off guard by it is way too high.

Here's the thing:

For every experience you plan to talk about in an interview—whether it's a formal behavioral question or a casual conversation—you should already know the answer to this question.

Before you walk in the door.

But here's what's even more powerful:

Don't wait for them to ask.

Proactively mention it.

"Looking back, if I were to do this again, I would..."

This does something really powerful for you.

**It shows you're reflective.**

You don't just move from project to project.
Sprint to sprint.
Role to role.

Just doing.

You pause.
You think about what went well—so you can do more of it.
You think about what didn't—so you can do less of it.

That's rare.

**It shows you will actually improve over time.**

You're not just hoping to get better.

You have a plan.

You've thought about how you'd change the process.

And ideally, you can show them how you applied that lesson the next time around.

That's icing on the cake.

But even if you can't—at least you have a vision for version 2.0.

More efficient.
More effective.
Better than 1.0.

**It shows humility.**

You're not arrogant.
You're not self-delusional.
You don't think you're perfect.

If you thought you were the greatest thing since sliced bread, you wouldn't think there was possibly any way to improve.

But you do.

And that's exactly the kind of person teams want to work with.

**The takeaway:**

For every example you're preparing, ask yourself:

→ What went well?
→ What didn't go as well?
→ What would I do differently next time?

Know these answers cold.

And when you're telling your story in the interview?

Don't wait for them to ask.

Tell them first.

What's an example from your experience where you'd do something differently the second time around?
