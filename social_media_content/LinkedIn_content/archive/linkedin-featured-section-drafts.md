# LinkedIn Featured Section Drafts

## Overview
LinkedIn's Featured section appears right below your About section and is prime real estate. You can feature:
- Posts
- Articles
- Links
- Media (PDFs, images)

I recommend 3 featured items:

---

## FEATURED ITEM #1: Lead Magnet / Free Resource

### Title:
**FREE: The Impact Equation Quick-Start Guide**

### Description (for LinkedIn post that links to it):
```
Your resume bullets are probably costing you interviews.

"Maintained spreadsheets for test results"

That's a task. Not an impact. Hiring managers see 500 of these.

The fix is what I call The Impact Equation:
[What you did] + [Evidence] + [How] + [Why it matters]

Same experience, transformed:
"Automated data tracking for 3 programs across a 10-person team. Built a Python script using the Azure DevOps API—cut maintenance time 85%, enabled daily executive reporting."

One tells them what you did. The other tells them what you're worth.

## FEATURED ITEM #2: Case Study / Proof Post

### Title:
**How I Got 4 Promotions in 7 Years (The System)**

### Content (LinkedIn Article or Long Post):

How I Got 4 Promotions in 7 Years at John Deere

(Without being the smartest coder in the room)

---

In 2018, I started at John Deere as a Mechanical Development Engineer.

By 2025, I was leading enterprise initiatives impacting 2,000+ engineers globally.

4 promotions. 3 major pivots. 7 years.

Here's exactly how I did it—and why most engineers get stuck.

---

THE PROBLEM

Universities teach you to calculate.
They don't teach you to navigate.

So you:
- Work hard
- Hit your deadlines
- Hope your boss notices
- Watch others get promoted

Sound familiar?

I was stuck there too. Until I realized:

Performance is not the differentiator.
Performance is the ENTRY FEE.

THE SYSTEM I BUILT

I started treating my career like an engineering problem:
- Identify the variables (Visibility, Impact, Sponsorship)
- Optimize the constraints
- Solve for X (Velocity)

Here's what I learned:

**1. THE IMPACT EQUATION**

Stop listing tasks. Start proving value.

Old: "Maintained spreadsheets"
New: "Automated tracking for 3 programs, cutting time by 85%, enabling daily executive visibility"

Same work. Different story. Different outcome.

**2. THE VISIBILITY PYRAMID**

Being good is Level 1.
Being known for being good is Level 4.

I made sure my skip-level (my boss's boss) knew my name.
How? Volunteered for the demo. Sent the summary email that got forwarded up.

If your boss gets hit by a bus, does the VP know your name?
If not, you're invisible.

**3. THE TROJAN HORSE**

I wanted to pivot from Mechanical to Software.
But I had zero software experience.

So I didn't ASK for a software project.
I TOOK a Mechanical problem and solved it with Software.

I automated my own job. Then showed the software team what I built.

Old Problem + New Tool = Pivot Portfolio.

**4. THE SERVICE-BASED ASK**

When I wanted promotion, I never said "I want more money."

I said: "I feel I've mastered my current scope. I'm looking for more responsibility so I can solve [Bigger Problem] for the team. What does the gap look like?"

This shifts the conversation from GREED to GROWTH.

THE RESULTS

- 4 Promotions in 7 years
- 3 Major Pivots (Civil to Mechanical to Software to Leadership)
- Currently impacting 2,000+ engineers
- Delivered $1B+ in programs to market
- Direct recognition from department directors

---

THE LESSON

Your career is an engineering problem.

Most people hope and wait.
Engineers identify variables and optimize.

I built a system. It worked for me.
Now I teach it to other engineers.

### Title:

## BONUS: Featured Post Ideas (High Engagement)

### Post Idea 1: "The Interview Pause"
```
The most confident thing you can do in an interview:

"That's a great question. Can I take a moment to think?"

Shows you're thoughtful, not reactive. Proves confidence, not nervousness. Gives you time to find your best example.

The interviewer isn't timing you. They're evaluating you.

Rushed answers sound desperate. Paused answers sound executive.

### Post Idea 2: "The Boring to Booming Transformation"
```
Your resume bullet: "Maintained spreadsheets for test results."

Let me fix that:

"Managed data for 3 programs across a 10-person team, 100 daily tests. Built a Python script using Azure DevOps API to automate tracking—cut maintenance 85%, enabled daily executive reporting."

Same experience. Completely different impression.

The formula: [What you did] + [Scale] + [How] + [Why it matters]

Your resume is not a job description. It's a highlight reel.

#resume #engineering #jobsearch
```
**Character count: ~420**

### Post Idea 3: "The Application Black Hole"
```
Applied to 50 jobs. Heard back from 2. Both rejections.

Welcome to the Application Black Hole.

Why it happens:
- Your bullets read like job descriptions
- Your resume uses industry jargon recruiters don't understand
- You're competing with 500 other "did the job" resumes

The fix isn't applying more. It's applying better.

I went from 5% callback rate to 40% using 3 changes:
- Impact Equation (outcomes, not tasks)
- Universal Translator (remove jargon)
- Pattern Interrupt (confidence, not desperation)
