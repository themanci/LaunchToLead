# LinkedIn Text Post - Networking for Introverts

---

## POST COPY:

If the thought of going to a career fair makes you sweat bullets...

If networking events make you want to hide in the corner...

If talking about yourself feels painfully uncomfortable...

You're not alone. But here's the truth:

**You need to train that little extrovert inside you to come out from time to time.**

I was super introverted all through high school and early college. Avoided social situations like the plague. Until I decided enough was enough.

Here's what actually worked:

---

**1. Accept that practice makes progress**

You won't magically become an extrovert overnight. That's not the goal.

But you CAN stretch these muscles. You CAN get more comfortable in uncomfortable situations.

The only way to get better at communicating with people you find intimidating? Do it anyway. Repeatedly.

---

**2. Set specific, measurable goals**

"I want to network more" is not a goal. It's a wish.

Real goals look like this:

→ "Every week I'll reach out to 5 new people on LinkedIn"
→ "Every week I'll go to my professor's office hours at least once"
→ "I'll attend SI sessions and exchange contact info with 1 new classmate"
→ "I'll join one new student org and meet 10 new people this semester"
→ "I'll introduce myself to 1 new person in my dorm every week"
→ "I'll join Toastmasters and practice public speaking"

Specific targets force you out of your comfort zone. Vague intentions don't.

---

**3. Start with what you're passionate about**

Here's the shortcut: it's way easier to be social about things you actually care about.

Join clubs that matter to you.
Meet people in contexts you enjoy.
Talk about topics that excite you.

Passion makes conversation flow naturally.

---

**Here's the reality check:**

If you're in an interview or standing in front of a recruiter, and you're so shy that it's hard to communicate with you...

How high do you think they'll rank you on "works well with others"?

Networking isn't optional. Communication skills aren't optional.

But the good news? They're learnable. Start small. Be consistent. Watch yourself grow.
