# LinkedIn Post: How to Answer "Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?"

---

**POST TEXT:**

In a recent coaching session, a client asked:

"How should I answer 'Where do you see yourself in 5 years?'"

Here's what I told them:

Skip the word "promotion."

But not because it's a clever interview trick.

Because **impact and growth should actually BE the goal.**

Here's the mindset shift:

If you genuinely focus on:
→ Tackling bigger challenges
→ Building deep expertise
→ Leading meaningful projects
→ Mentoring others

The promotions will come as a **result** of that work.

You're not pretending to care about impact just to get promoted. You're actually caring about impact—and the title catches up.

That's the difference between playing a game and building a career.

**Here's the formula:**

**1. Lead with contribution, not titles**

❌ "I want to be promoted to Staff Engineer."

✅ "I want to tackle bigger, more ambiguous challenges and drive real value for the team and organization."

**2. Break it into phases**

- **Near-term:** Build deep expertise in [specific area]
- **Mid-term:** Lead larger projects and initiatives
- **Long-term:** Mentor others and multiply my impact across the team

**3. Connect it to the company's mission**

Show that your growth aligns with their goals. You're not just climbing a ladder—you're building something together.

A solid answer sounds like this:

"In 5 years, I want to be tackling bigger technical challenges, growing as a technical lead, mentoring junior engineers, and driving meaningful impact for the team. I see it happening in phases—first building deep expertise, then leading larger initiatives, and eventually helping others grow too."

Notice what's NOT in there:
- No specific titles
- No "I want to be promoted"
- No gaming the system

What IS in there:
- Genuine growth mindset
- Team contribution
- Clear progression
- Authentic ambition

The interviewer wants to know you're thinking long-term and that investing in you will pay off for the organization.

But more importantly—**this is how you should actually think about your career.**

Chase impact. Chase growth. Chase contribution.

The titles will follow.
