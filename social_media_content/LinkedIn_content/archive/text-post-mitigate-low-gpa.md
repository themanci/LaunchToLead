# LinkedIn Post: Mitigate a Low GPA

## Post Text

Let's be honest about low GPAs.

Some companies have hard cutoffs. No amount of projects or networking will change that.

But many companies don't.

And for those, here's how to mitigate a GPA that doesn't reflect your true ability:

𝟭. 𝗧𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆
The transition to college is brutal for many students. If you struggled early but improved later—show that growth trajectory. "My last 4 semesters averaged a 3.4" tells a different story than your cumulative 2.7.

𝟮. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗚𝗣𝗔
If your major GPA is higher than your overall, use it. "Engineering GPA: 3.3" is 100% legitimate on your resume.

𝟯. 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝘀
A's in Thermodynamics, Machine Design, or Control Systems? Mention them. High scores on your capstone project? Include it.

𝟰. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁
Personal projects, open-source contributions, or hackathon wins can demonstrate skills that your transcript doesn't capture.

𝟱. 𝗚𝗲𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘀
Networking and referrals help you bypass automated filters. A human can see potential that an ATS can't.

Will this work every time? No.

But it works more often than you'd think.
