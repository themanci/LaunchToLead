# LinkedIn Text Post - Confident Without Being Arrogant

---

## POST COPY:

A client asked me something that I think a lot of people struggle with:

"How do I sell myself and sound confident without coming across as arrogant?"

Great question. Here's what I told them:

**Confidence comes from knowing yourself.**

→ Know your experiences and projects deeply
→ Know the details with certainty
→ Know YOUR contribution—not "we delivered," but what YOU did
→ Practice until your delivery is natural
→ Believe you bring something unique to the table

When you genuinely know your value and believe you belong in that role—confidence shows up naturally.

**Humility comes from honesty.**

→ Give credit where credit is due
→ Acknowledge what teammates contributed
→ Ask intelligent questions that show curiosity
→ Admit what you don't know
→ Share examples of failure and what you learned

Here's the key insight:

𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐝𝐨𝐧'𝐭 𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬.

They don't admit gaps in knowledge.
They don't set themselves up to learn from others.
They don't talk about how they'd improve.
They claim to have "done everything."

𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐡—𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐬.

They own their contributions AND give credit to others.
They share failures AND what they learned.
They ask questions AND demonstrate expertise.

The balance isn't a trick. It's authenticity.

If you're preparing for interviews and worried about how you're coming across—practice with someone who can give you honest feedback.

That's often where the confidence actually comes from.
