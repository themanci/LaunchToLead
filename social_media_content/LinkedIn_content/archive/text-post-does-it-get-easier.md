# LinkedIn Text Post - Does It Get Easier?

---

## POST COPY:

A client asked me something during a coaching session that I think a lot of students are wondering:

"Does it get easier, less stressful, and less hectic after school is over and I'm in the real world at a job?"

This client was working almost full-time while going to school full-time.

My answer: Yes. In many ways, it absolutely does.

Here's why:

𝟏. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐲 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬.

Right now, you're grinding with one nagging question: "Is this going to pay off?"

When you land that job with a good salary and great benefits—that question gets answered. You made it. The "promised land" is real, and you're standing in it.

𝟐. 𝐍𝐨 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐣𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬.

Balancing school, work, and personal life takes an incredible amount of hours, dedication, motivation, structure, time management, prioritization, and execution.

When you graduate? You mainly focus on one thing. The mental load drops significantly.

The stress peaks flatten out too. School has these huge spikes—exams, finals, project deadlines—all while working. Work stress exists, but it's more consistent. Fewer extreme highs and lows.

𝟑. 𝐅𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐲.

As your career progresses, you might choose to take on more—senior engineer, staff engineer, manager. But that stress comes with a known trade-off: more pay, more responsibility, more influence.

In school, you're working hard for a "potential" reward.
In your career, it's a "certain" reward.

That shift feels different.

Here's what I want every engineering student working full-time or part-time while in school to remember:

𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐨𝐨 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬.

No state lasts forever. Especially this one.

It's only a handful of years from your life. And it will be over.

Keep seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
Hang in there.
You'll get exactly what you set out to get.
