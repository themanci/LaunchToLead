# LinkedIn Post: Low GPA? Here's How to Own It and Still Land the Job

---

**POST TEXT:**

Worried your low GPA will tank your engineering job search?

Here's the truth: it doesn't have to.

In a recent coaching session, a client asked me how to handle a sub-3.0 GPA caused by some tough life circumstances early in college.

Here's what I told them:

---

**1. Always include your GPA on your resume.**

I know it sounds counterintuitive. But if you leave it off, recruiters will assume the worst.

A 2.6 on paper is better than "probably a 1.5" in their head.

Pro tip: If your major GPA or core engineering GPA is higher, use that instead. Just label it clearly.

---

**2. Own it. Don't hide from it.**

If you had extenuating circumstances—family issues, health problems, a parent passing—you can mention it. But keep it brief.

Don't over-explain. Don't seek pity. Just acknowledge it and pivot.

Here's the framework:

**A - Acknowledge:** "My GPA is 2.6. I struggled early on due to some personal circumstances."

**B - Bridge:** "But I've made significant improvements since then."

**C - Capability:** "I raised my major GPA to 3.2, earned A's in my hardest courses like thermodynamics and process controls, and gained hands-on experience through internships."

This shows maturity, accountability, and resilience—not excuses.

---

**3. Highlight the upward trajectory.**

Did you start at a 1.7 and climb to a 2.6? That's a story of grit.

Did you get A's in your toughest engineering classes even with a low overall GPA? That's proof of capability.

Recruiters aren't just looking at the number. They're trying to answer one question:

*"Can this person do the job?"*

Give them evidence that says yes.

---

**4. Shift the focus to experience.**

Strong internships? Meaningful projects? Leadership roles?

These matter more than you think—especially in STEM, where only about 12% of jobs have strict GPA minimums.

Package your story:
"Life challenges hit early, but I've rebounded with consistent performance in my major and real-world experience through internships and projects."

---

**5. Remember: GPA fades fast.**

Here's the best news:

After your first job—even if it's entry-level—no one cares about your GPA anymore.

One year of work experience eclipses four years of grades.

Your goal right now is just to get that first opportunity. Once you're in, you prove yourself with results, not transcripts.

---

**Bottom line:**

A low GPA is not a death sentence.

It's a chapter in your story—not the whole book.

Own it. Explain it. Show your growth.

And go get that job.
