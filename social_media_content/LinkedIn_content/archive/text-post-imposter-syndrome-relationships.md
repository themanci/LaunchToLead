# LinkedIn Text Post - Conquer Imposter Syndrome with Relationships

---

## POST COPY:

You're at the starting line now.

Maybe you took an unorthodox path to get here. Maybe you're older than others on your team. Maybe you had detours that delayed you. Maybe you didn't go to the "right" school.

**Here's what matters:** You're here. Now.

Forget about how you got here. Forget about the path you had to take versus what others took. That story is over.

---

## You Earned This

Someone chose you for this role. You didn't sneak in the door while no one was looking. You earned it.

This isn't about someone's benevolence or because they felt bad for you.

You earned your spot. You belong here. The fact that you're here proves it.

---

## Stop the Self-Doubt

This is NOT the time for self-doubt. This is NOT the time for second-guessing yourself.

This is the time to put your foot on the gas.

---

## What You CAN Control

Here's the truth: You can't control what happened in your past. You can't control what might happen in the future that's out of your hands.

But there's ONE thing you have complete control over that nobody can take from you:

**How hard you work.**

## Your Unfair Advantage

Your unorthodox path? That's not a weakness. That's your advantage.

You have life experience. You have perspective. You have resilience because you've already overcome obstacles just to get here.

While others are just starting their journey, you're starting with a head start—not in credentials, but in grit.

---

## The Move

Outwork everyone.

For the next 10 years, make your effort non-negotiable. Show up. Learn. Grow. Ask questions. Expand your skills. Close your gaps.

Outwork everyone, and I promise you—you won't just be "where you think you should be."

You'll be way past it.

---

## The Real Truth

You earned your seat at the table.

Now earn everything that comes after by doing the work.
