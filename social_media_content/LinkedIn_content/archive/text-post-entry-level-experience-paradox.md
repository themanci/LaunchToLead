# LinkedIn Post: The Entry-Level Experience Paradox

---

**POST TEXT:**

"Entry-level position. Requirements: 1-3 years of experience."

If you're a student or recent grad, you've seen this a hundred times.

And it feels like a catch-22:

How do you get experience if you need experience to get the job?

Here's the thing — you probably have more experience than you think. And there are ways to build more before you graduate.

Let me break it down:

**1. You already have experience. Highlight it.**

Internships, co-ops, coursework projects, capstone projects, lab work — this all counts.

Stop underselling yourself. That senior design project where you built a working prototype? That's engineering experience. Frame it that way on your resume.

**2. Build independent, self-driven projects.**

This is the secret weapon most students don't use.

When you work on something outside of class — not assigned by a professor, not given by a manager — you're demonstrating:
→ Passion for engineering
→ Self-motivation
→ Curiosity and initiative

These projects don't have to be massive. Build something. Break something. Learn something. Document it. Put it on GitHub or in a portfolio.

Hiring managers notice when someone does engineering work because they WANT to, not just because they have to.

**3. Consider a co-op. Delay graduation if needed.**

I know this sounds counterintuitive. Everyone wants to graduate on time.

But here's the reality:

Delaying graduation by one semester to complete a co-op (1 semester + 1 summer of real work experience) is a tiny drop in the bucket over a 40+ year career.

That extra experience can be the difference between "not enough experience" and "you're hired."

One semester now. Decades of benefit later.

**4. Choose engineering-related part-time work.**

If you're working part-time during school, try to make it count toward your career.

I'd rather see you:
→ TA a class
→ Tutor an engineering subject
→ Work in a campus lab
→ Work part-time at a local engineering firm

...even if it pays a little less than retail or food service.

That "lower paying" job is actually an investment. It builds experience, skills, and stories you can tell in interviews.

---

**The bottom line:**

You're not as stuck as you think.

You can highlight what you've already done.
You can build projects on your own.
You can extend your runway with a co-op.
You can choose work that builds your resume.

The experience gap is real — but it's not insurmountable.

Start building now.
