# LinkedIn Post: How to Answer "Tell Me About Your Biggest Mistake"

---

**POST TEXT:**

A coaching client asked me yesterday:

"How do I answer 'Tell me about your biggest mistake'?"

Here's the thing nobody tells you:

You don't have to share your ACTUAL biggest mistake.

Don't walk into an interview and say:
"Freshman year of college, I got drunk and drove a golf cart into a pond."

❌ That's not what they're looking for.

But also don't give a fake answer like:
"I'm too much of a perfectionist."

❌ Interviewers see right through that.

Here's the formula that works:

**1. Choose something real but palatable**
Pick a genuine mistake that isn't central to the core skills of the job you're interviewing for.

**2. Own it completely**
Show vulnerability, humility, and accountability. No blame-shifting. No excuses.

**3. Show the redemption**
This is the critical part. What did you learn? What did you change? How do you prevent it now?

A solid example:
"Early in my career, I spent too much time trying to figure things out myself before asking for help. I thought asking questions made me look incompetent. I now know that asking for help earlier actually makes me more efficient and builds better relationships with my team."

The interviewer isn't looking for your confession.

They're looking for:
→ Self-awareness
→ Ability to reflect
→ Growth mindset
→ Accountability

Give them a real answer. Just not your deepest regret.
