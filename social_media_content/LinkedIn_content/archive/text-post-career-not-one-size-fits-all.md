# LinkedIn Post: Career Is Not One Size Fits All

---

**POST TEXT:**

Stop letting people tell you what you should want.

There are too many "gurus" out there presenting their personal preferences as universal truths.

Here's the reality:

**Some people thrive at big companies.**
→ Stability. Predictable schedules. Clear roles. Established processes.

**Some people thrive at small companies.**
→ Wearing many hats. Closer relationships. More visibility.

**Some people thrive at startups.**
→ Taking something from 0 to 1. High growth. High impact.

**Some people thrive building their own business.**
→ Bringing their vision to life. Full ownership. Full accountability.

And guess what?

Some people would absolutely hate any of those options.

That's not a character flaw. That's called being human.

Here's what bothers me:

People who chose path A telling everyone that path B, C, and D are for "suckers."

That's not wisdom. That's projection.

The truth is:
• Every path has trade-offs
• Every path has pros and cons
• Every path is right for someone and wrong for someone else

You're not a sucker for working at a Fortune 500.
You're not a sellout for staying at a small company.
You're not reckless for joining a startup.
You're not crazy for starting a business.

You're making the decision that's right for YOU.

"Be a student, not a follower." — Jim Rohn

Listen to everyone. Learn from everyone.
Then make your own decision based on what YOU want out of life.

Career is not one size fits all.
Life is not one size fits all.

Stop following. Start deciding.
