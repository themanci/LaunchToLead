# LinkedIn Text Post - Engineering School Didn't Teach This

---

## POST COPY:

A client said something to me recently that stopped me in my tracks:

"It's like engineering school taught us how to be engineers, but not how to get a good job."

She was frustrated. Four years of thermodynamics, circuits, data structures, differential equations...

But zero courses on:
→ How to write a resume that gets callbacks
→ How to network without feeling awkward
→ How to answer "tell me about yourself"
→ How to negotiate salary
→ How to stand out in a stack of 500 applicants

And she's right.

Think about it:

You spend 4+ years learning complex technical skills. You survive brutal exams. You build projects. You pull all-nighters.

Then graduation comes and suddenly you're expected to:
• Craft a compelling personal brand
• Navigate applicant tracking systems
• Tell stories that showcase your impact
• Interview with confidence
• Negotiate offers

...with zero formal training.

It's like learning to build a race car but never learning how to drive it.

The skills that get you the job are completely different from the skills that make you good at the job.

And most engineers figure this out the hard way—after months of rejected applications and ghosted interviews.

Here's what I've learned after 7 years in engineering and helping students land roles:

The job search is a skill. And like any skill, it can be learned.

You just have to treat it like another engineering problem to solve.

For anyone feeling this gap right now: you're not alone. And it's not your fault.

The system just never taught you this part.

Did your school prepare you for the job search? I'm curious what your experience was 👇
