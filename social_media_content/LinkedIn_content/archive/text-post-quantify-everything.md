# LinkedIn Text Post - Quantify Everything

---

## POST COPY:

Your resume is full of lies.

Not intentional ones. But they're boring enough that they sound like it.

"Maintained devices." "Improved performance." "Supported team members."

If I had a nickel for every entry-level resume with these kinds of statements, I wouldn't need to coach anyone.

**Here's the problem:** Vague job descriptions don't prove anything. They turn on the BS meter.

## The Fix: Add Numbers

The moment you quantify something, it becomes credible.

Instead of "Maintained devices," say "Maintained 150+ network devices across 8 facilities, achieving 99.2% uptime."

Instead of "Improved performance," say "Reduced API latency by 38%, cutting response time from 800ms to 500ms."

The data does the work for you. The hiring manager doesn't have to guess—they can see exactly what you did and how much it mattered.

## You Don't Need Perfect Data

Here's what I tell people: If you don't have exact numbers, estimate.

But estimate conservatively and with research.

Look at historical data. Ask a former manager. Check company reports or industry benchmarks. Make an educated, defensible estimate.

"Packet loss under 1%" is better than nothing. "Supported 800+ store locations" tells a story.

A well-researched estimate beats a vague description every single time.

## The Real Play

The real play is this: Start tracking your metrics NOW.

Don't wait until you need to update your resume in 6 months.

Start documenting your numbers today—devices supported, response times, error rates, deployments, lines of code, bugs fixed, whatever is relevant to your role.

When it's time to update your resume, you'll have actual data. Not estimates. Reality.

## Why This Matters

Hiring managers review hundreds of resumes. They've learned to spot vague language from a mile away.

They know that lack of specificity = lack of impact.

But when you throw numbers at them—real numbers, credible numbers—it cuts through the noise.

It says: "I did something measurable. I can prove it. And I was paying attention to what I was doing."

That's the difference between a generic candidate and someone worth interviewing.

## Your Move

Audit your resume right now.

Find every vague statement. Replace it with a number.

If you don't have exact data, research it and estimate. Make it defensible.

Then, going forward, start tracking. Metrics. Percentages. Quantities. Whatever makes your work visible.

Your future resume will thank you.
