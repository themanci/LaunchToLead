# LinkedIn Post: The "So What" Exercise for Career Decisions

I was coaching someone last week who had an offer on the table.

New company. Exciting opportunity. Better role.

But they couldn't pull the trigger.

Their mind was racing with "what ifs":
→ What if I get laid off in a year?
→ What if the new company isn't stable?
→ What if I regret leaving the big company comfort?
→ What if the benefits aren't as good?
→ What if it doesn't pan out?

These fears were paralyzing them.

So I asked them to do something simple:

**Write down every "what if" — then answer it.**

Not just acknowledge it. ANSWER it.

---

"What if I get laid off in a year?"

Okay. So what? Then what happens?

"Well... I'd have to find another job."

Do you have an emergency fund?

"Yeah, 6-9 months of expenses."

So your family won't be homeless. You won't be under a bridge. You'll have runway to find something new.

Could you go back to your previous employer if you left on good terms?

"Probably, yeah."

So... what exactly is the catastrophe here?

This is the thing about "what ifs":

When they stay abstract in your head, they're monsters.
When you write them down and follow them to the end, they're manageable.

Most people stop at the fear.
They never ask: "Okay, but then what?"

Try this:

1. Write down every "what if" that's haunting you
2. For each one, ask: "So what? Then what happens?"
3. Keep going. "And then what? And then what?"
4. Follow the chain to the end

By the time you reach the final "and then what," you'll realize:
→ You're not going to be homeless
→ Your life isn't going to end
→ The worst case is survivable
→ The fear was bigger than the reality

The vague fear is always scarier than the specific answer.

What's the "what if" that's been haunting YOUR career decisions?

Write it down. Answer it. See what happens.
