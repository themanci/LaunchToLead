# LinkedIn Post: Resume Before & After — Network Engineer

---

**POST TEXT:**

This is what most engineering resumes look like:

"Supported WAN and LAN connectivity for 750+ retail locations."
"Maintained VLAN configurations and DHCP scopes."
"Handled escalations involving routing and switching."

Sounds fine, right?

Here's the problem:

So does every other resume in the pile.

When I worked with this engineer, we didn't change what they did.

We changed how they told the story.

This was after our FIRST session. Out of three.

Same person. Same job. Same experience.

But instead of listing tasks, we showed impact:

→ Administrated infrastructure across 750+ locations, resolving wired and wireless escalations at scale

→ Established WAN performance baselines (≤1% packet loss, <100ms latency), enabling proactive ISP escalation and reducing repeat incidents

→ Supported migration of ~350 retail locations between Meraki organizations, configuring and validating devices prior to handoff

The difference?

Before: "I did stuff."
After: "Here's the measurable impact I created."

One gets filtered out by ATS.
The other gets you a phone call.

If your resume reads like a job description, you're invisible.

If it reads like a results report, you're unforgettable.

I help new and early-career engineers make this transformation — and this was just session 1 of 3.
