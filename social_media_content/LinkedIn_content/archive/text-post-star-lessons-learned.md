# LinkedIn Text Post - Master STAR Method Plus Lessons Learned

---

## POST COPY:

Here's what I coach my clients to use:

The STAR method is good. But most people stop at the wrong place—right after Results.

That's where most candidates freeze when the interviewer asks: "What would you do differently?"

**Here's the problem:** Most people teach you STAR. But nobody teaches you what comes AFTER the Results.

That's where the real power is.

## The Missing Piece

When you finish your STAR story at "R" (Results), you've told what happened. But you haven't answered the question the interviewer is secretly asking:

"Did you actually LEARN from this?"

That's where most candidates get stuck. They deliver a polished story, but then they're caught off-guard by the most obvious follow-up question.

---

## Here's What Actually Works

**Add an L to your STAR.**

**S** = Situation  
**T** = Task  
**A** = Action  
**R** = Results  
**L** = Lessons Learned (What I'd Do Differently)

When you end your story with "Here's what I learned" or "Next time, I would approach it by doing X instead," you've just told the interviewer:

→ You reflect on your work  
→ You're not arrogant (you admit gaps)  
→ You're coachable  
→ You actually care about improvement  

These are the people companies WANT to hire.

## How to Execute This

**Step 1: Document the full story**

Write out the entire narrative in 2-3 paragraphs. Include dates, names, specific numbers, what you were thinking, what you learned. Extreme detail.

**Step 2: Extract the bullets**

Boil that down to 5-7 bullet points you can memorize and deliver conversationally in ~2 minutes.

**Step 3: Practice obsessively**

Not robotic. Natural. Like you're telling a friend what happened. Practice until you can deliver it while thinking about something else (that's how you know it's truly internalized).

**Step 4: When you get the follow-up**

"What would you do differently?"

You already know the answer. You practiced it. You own it.

## The Bottom Line

If you're preparing for interviews and you're only practicing STAR—you're leaving wins on the table.

Add the L. Own your stories. Demonstrate growth.

That's what moves candidates from "good interview" to "we're hiring them immediately."
