# Your Manager's Job Is To Give You Feedback

**Topic:** Managers who avoid giving concrete feedback are failing their teams

**Hook Options:**
1. "You're doing great." Then why didn't I get an above-average review?
2. Your manager is getting paid to give you feedback. Make them earn it.
3. If giving feedback makes you uncomfortable, maybe you shouldn't be a manager.

"You're doing great."

Then why didn't I get an above-average review?

I was talking with a client recently who's been dealing with this for years.

Throughout the year, they ask for feedback.
They want to improve.
They want specifics.

Their manager's response?

"You're doing well. Keep it up."

Then year-end review comes.

Average score.

So they ask: "What could I have done more of?"

And they get some generic, fluffy answer that could apply to literally anyone.

This has been going on for YEARS.

And I know they're not alone.

If you're a manager, I need you to hear this:

Part of what you are getting paid for is giving your people feedback on how they can improve.

That's the job.

If that makes you uncomfortable...
If you're afraid of having tough conversations...
If you're worried about hurting their feelings...

You are falling short as a manager.

I'll say it directly:

If you can't get comfortable delivering honest, specific feedback—maybe management isn't the right role for you.

Here's what I see constantly:

People feel gaslit.

Their manager tells them everything is fine all year.
Then the formal review comes and the score doesn't match.

They're left confused, frustrated, and stuck.

Meanwhile, their peers who got honest feedback all year?
They actually improved. They got promoted.

**To employees:**

Challenge your manager to give you specifics.

Don't accept "you're doing great" as an answer.

Ask:
→ "What's one thing I could do better this quarter?"
→ "If I wanted to exceed expectations, what would that look like?"
→ "What would you need to see from me to score higher next review?"

Push for tangible, actionable feedback you can work on quarter to quarter.

**To managers:**

Give them those things.

Yes, it's uncomfortable.
Yes, it takes courage.
Yes, it might feel awkward for 30 minutes.

But that 30 minutes of discomfort?

It translates into a much better working relationship.
More trust.
More growth.
Better outcomes for everyone.

Your people WANT to improve.

Help them do it.

Who else has experienced this disconnect between "you're doing great" and their actual review score?
