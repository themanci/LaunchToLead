# LinkedIn Post: Don't Reveal Deal Breakers Before You Have an Offer

I keep seeing engineers shoot themselves in the foot during interviews.

They bring up deal breakers before they even have an offer.

"I'm not sure I'd relocate."
"I really prefer remote."
"That salary range might be too low."
"I don't love that location."

Stop. You're killing your leverage.

Here's the thing most people don't realize:

Before you have an offer, you're competing. You're being compared to other candidates. You're being evaluated not just on skills, but on "fit" and "ease of hire."

When you start listing reasons you might say no, you're planting seeds in their mind:
→ "This person has baggage"
→ "There's another candidate without these concerns"
→ "Why take the risk?"

But here's the kicker:

Things you think are deal breakers RIGHT NOW might not be deal breakers once you're the top candidate.

Companies make exceptions for people they really want.
They increase offers.
They negotiate remote policies.
They find creative solutions.

But only if they want YOU badly enough.

And they won't get to that point if you've already given them reasons to pass.

So what should you do?

Before the offer:
• Be agreeable
• Be flexible
• Be enthusiastic
• Keep your concerns to yourself

After the offer:
• Now you negotiate
• Now you're transparent
• Now you discuss the trade-offs
• Now you have leverage

The offer is when the power shifts.

Don't give away your cards before you're even at the table.
