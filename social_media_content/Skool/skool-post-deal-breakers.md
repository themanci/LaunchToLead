# Don't Reveal Deal Breakers Before You Have an Offer

## The Mistake I Keep Seeing

I keep seeing engineers shoot themselves in the foot during interviews.

They bring up deal breakers before they even have an offer:

> "I'm not sure I'd relocate."
> "I really prefer remote."
> "That salary range might be too low."
> "I don't love that location."

Every time I hear this, I cringe. You're killing your leverage.

## Why This Hurts You

Before you have an offer, you're **competing**. You're being compared to other candidates. You're being evaluated not just on skills, but on "fit" and "ease of hire."

When you start listing reasons you might say no, you're planting seeds in their mind:

| What You Say | What They Think |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "I'm not sure about relocating" | "This person has baggage" |
| "That salary is probably too low" | "The other candidate didn't mention this" |
| "I really need fully remote" | "Why take the risk on this one?" |

You're giving them reasons to pick someone else.

## Here's the Kicker

Things you think are deal breakers RIGHT NOW might not be deal breakers once you're the top candidate.

Companies make exceptions for people they really want:
- 💰 They increase offers
- 🏠 They negotiate remote policies
- 📍 They make relocation exceptions
- ✨ They find creative solutions

But only if they want YOU badly enough.

And they won't get to that point if you've already given them reasons to pass.

## The Strategy

### Before the Offer:
- ✅ Be agreeable
- ✅ Be flexible
- ✅ Be enthusiastic
- ✅ Keep your concerns to yourself

### After the Offer:
- ✅ Now you negotiate
- ✅ Now you're transparent
- ✅ Now you discuss the trade-offs
- ✅ Now you have leverage

The offer is when the power shifts. Before that, you're auditioning. After that, they're selling.

## Cards to Keep Close to Your Chest

Things you should NOT bring up before you have an offer:

- 🏠 "I don't want to relocate"
- 💻 "I need fully remote"
- 📍 "I don't like that region"
- 💵 "That's below my minimum"
- 📅 "The start date doesn't work"
- 🎯 "That team isn't my first choice"

All of these become negotiating points AFTER the offer. Before the offer, they're reasons to pass on you.

## Discussion Questions

1. **Have you ever brought up a deal breaker too early and regretted it?**

2. **What's the hardest thing to stay quiet about during interviews?**

3. **Has a company ever made an exception for you after you became their top choice?**

*Get the offer first. Then negotiate everything.*
