## Slide 1: Title (30 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: "Resource Activation System™" title]**

Hey everyone, welcome back to the Launch Method classroom. Today we're covering **Method 2.2: The Resource Activation System**.

**[PAUSE]**

This is all about turning your tuition—the money you're already spending—into hidden job market access. Let's dive in.

**Timing:** 30 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Confident, energetic open. Smile. This is a "hidden treasure" reveal.

## Slide 2: The Problem (1 minute 15 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: Problem slide with stats]**

Here's the problem. You're paying anywhere from **$20,000 to $50,000 per year** for your university education.

**[PAUSE]**

But most students completely ignore the career center, the alumni database, engineering societies, and professors who can connect them directly to hidden jobs.

**[PAUSE - LET THIS LAND]**

And here's the kicker: **70 to 85 percent of jobs** aren't even publicly posted. They're filled through networks—networks you already have access to.

**[PAUSE]**

So while you're stuck in what I call "cold apply hell"—sending out hundreds of applications with a **2% success rate**—your classmates are landing roles through resources you both pay for. They're just actually using them.

**Timing:** 1 minute 15 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Build frustration with pacing. Emphasize the irony—"you BOTH pay for this."  
**Emphasis:** "70 to 85 percent," "2% success rate," "cold apply hell"

## Slide 3: The Solution (1 minute 30 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: Solution slide with quote box]**

So what's the solution?

**[PAUSE]**

Stop treating university resources as "optional extras." Start treating them as your **pre-built professional network** with direct access to hiring managers.

**[PAUSE]**

Here's a stat for you: Students who use career services are **1.5 times more likely** to secure a job within six months of graduation. One and a half times. That's huge.

**[PAUSE]**

The Resource Activation System teaches you to **audit, activate, and leverage** the four pillars of university resources for maximum job search ROI.

**[PAUSE]**

Think of it like this: You've already paid for the gym membership. Now it's time to actually work out.

**Timing:** 1 minute 30 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Shift energy from frustration to empowerment. "You already have this."  
**Emphasis:** "Pre-built professional network," "1.5 times more likely," "audit, activate, and leverage"

## Slide 4: The 4 Pillars - Part 1 (1 minute 30 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: Career Center + Alumni Database cards]**

Let's break down the four pillars. These are your four activation zones.

**[PAUSE]**

**Pillar 1: The Career Center.**  
Most students walk past this building every day and never go in. Here's what you're missing:
- Employer info sessions—companies literally come to YOUR campus to recruit
- Mock networking practice—so you don't sound awkward when it matters
- Industry salary data—this is gold for negotiation later
- And here's the question to ask: "Who recruits here most often for my major?"

**[PAUSE]**

**Pillar 2: The Alumni Database.**  
This is your secret weapon. When you reach out to fellow alumni with a personalized message, you get a **30 to 50 percent response rate**. Compare that to less than 10% for generic cold outreach.

**[PAUSE]**

Pro tip: Filter for people who graduated **3 to 7 years ago**. They're relatable, they remember the struggle, and they're often in hiring roles now. Lead with your shared school connection—that's tribal bonding. Then follow up with your LinkedIn profile.

**Timing:** 1 minute 30 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Slow down for the "question to ask" and "pro tip" moments—these are actionable gold.  
**Emphasis:** "30 to 50 percent," "3 to 7 years ago," "tribal bonding"

## Slide 5: The 4 Pillars - Part 2 (1 minute 30 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: Engineering Societies + Professors cards]**

**Pillar 3: Engineering Societies.**  
ASME, IEEE, SWE, ASCE—whatever your discipline. For **$25 to $50 per year**, you get access to exclusive job boards, mentorship programs, and networking events.

**[PAUSE]**

Here's an underrated hack: **Volunteer** for a role in your chapter—event coordinator, treasurer, whatever. You get face-time with officers who have industry connections. Plus, most societies now offer virtual webinars where you can network in the chat and Q&A.

**[PAUSE]**

**Pillar 4: Professors.**  
Especially adjunct professors—these are industry professionals teaching part-time. They're dual-hatted. They have one foot in academia and one foot in the real world.

**[PAUSE]**

Go to office hours **mid-semester**, not during finals week when they're swamped. Reference their research or a project from class, then ask: "Do you know anyone working in [this field]?" And after they make an intro, send a recap email thanking them and summarizing what you learned.

**Timing:** 1 minute 30 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Casual, conversational energy. The "underrated hack" and "dual-hatted" phrases should feel like insider tips.  
**Emphasis:** "$25 to $50," "Volunteer," "adjunct professors," "mid-semester"

## Slide 6: The Resource Audit (1 minute 15 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: Resource Audit process]**

Okay, so how do you actually activate these pillars? Start with a **Resource Audit**.

**[PAUSE]**

Set a timer for **30 minutes**. Brainstorm every portal, office, club, or connection you've heard of but ignored. Write it all down.

**[PAUSE]**

Then track it in a simple spreadsheet with four columns:
- **Resource:** Career center, alumni portal, ASME chapter, Professor Smith
- **Contact:** Name or email of who to reach
- **Ask Made:** What you requested—intro, advice, resume review
- **Outcome:** Response, referral, interview, whatever happened

**[PAUSE]**

This turns passive awareness into active wins. You stop saying "I should probably do that someday" and start saying "I did that, and here's what happened."

**Timing:** 1 minute 15 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Actionable, step-by-step energy. Walk them through the process like a coach.  
**Emphasis:** "30 minutes," "four columns," "passive awareness into active wins"

## Slide 7: Why This Works (1 minute 30 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: Math + Psychology sections]**

Let's talk about **why** this works—both the math and the psychology.

**[PAUSE]**

**The Math:**  
Referrals boost your odds **4 times** compared to cold applications. Four times. And alumni respond at **30 to 50 percent** when you personalize your message, versus less than 10% when you send generic blasts.

**[PAUSE]**

**The Psychology:**  
Two things are happening here. First, **tribal connection**. When you say "fellow alum," you create instant trust. It lowers defenses. You're not a stranger—you're part of the same tribe.

**[PAUSE]**

Second, **pay it forward**. Most professionals genuinely want to help the next generation. You're giving them an easy, low-friction way to do something good. They feel good, you get help—it's a win-win.

**[PAUSE]**

And here's a bonus: These resources often extend **1 to 5 years post-graduation**. Your access doesn't expire when you walk across that stage.

**Timing:** 1 minute 30 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Balance data with emotion. "Four times" is data. "Tribal connection" is emotion.  
**Emphasis:** "4 times," "tribal connection," "pay it forward," "1 to 5 years post-graduation"

## Slide 8: Action Items (1 minute 30 seconds)

**[ON SCREEN: Checklist of action items]**

Alright, let's bring this home. Here are your action items for this week.

**[PAUSE]**

**Number one:** Schedule a **30-minute Resource Audit**. List every career service, society, and professor contact you have. Do this today.

**[PAUSE]**

**Number two:** Book a **career center appointment**. Ask them: "Who recruits here most often for my major?" Write down those company names.

**[PAUSE]**

**Number three:** Search your **alumni database** for five people at your target companies who graduated 3 to 7 years ago. Message them this week.

**[PAUSE]**

**Number four:** Join **one engineering society**—ASME, IEEE, SWE, whatever fits your discipline—and attend their next virtual event. Just show up.

**[PAUSE]**

**Number five:** Visit **one professor's office hours** and ask: "Do you know anyone working in [your target field]?" Be specific about the field.

**[PAUSE - SLOWER]**

Here's the bottom line: Stop paying for resources you don't use. **Activate them this week.** You've already paid for the access—now go claim it.

**[PAUSE]**

That's Method 2.2, the Resource Activation System. See you in the next session.

**Timing:** 1 minute 30 seconds  
**Delivery Tip:** Checklist energy—clear, directive, empowering. End with authority: "Activate them this week."  
**Emphasis:** "30-minute Resource Audit," "Who recruits here most," "3 to 7 years ago," "Activate them this week"

## Delivery Tips Summary

- **Energy Arc:** Start confident → Build frustration (problem) → Shift to empowerment (solution) → End with authority (action)
- **Pacing:** Slow down for stats and actionable tips. Speed up slightly for transitions.
- **Emphasis:** Use vocal underlining for numbers (4x, 30-50%, 1.5x) and key phrases ("cold apply hell," "tribal connection," "activate them").
- **Pauses:** Strategic pauses after key stats let them land. Don't rush.
- **Authenticity:** This is about revealing a hidden advantage. Channel "insider sharing a secret" energy.
