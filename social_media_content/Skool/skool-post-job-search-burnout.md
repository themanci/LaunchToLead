⚠️ Your Job Search Feels Broken (It's Not)

## POST BODY:

Hey community 👋

I want to talk about something I see 90% of job seekers go through—and it usually ends with burnout around week 8-10.

Here's what I'm noticing: People aren't failing at job searching. They're just not prepared for how long it actually takes.

## The Reality Check

**The median job search is 68 days.**

Not 2 weeks. Not 4 weeks. **68 days.**

That's 10 weeks from first application to offer.

If you're panicking at week 4, you're actually right on pace. But most people don't know this, so they burn out thinking something is wrong.

## The Burnout Cycle (You're Probably in This Right Now)

**Weeks 1-2: Optimism**  
"I'll find something fast." You apply everywhere. Energy is high. ✅

**Weeks 3-6: Reality Check**  
Few responses. Panic starts. You apply MORE, not smarter. 📊

**Weeks 7-10: Desperation**  
You're applying to jobs you don't want. Cover letters are generic. Motivation is dying. 😤

**Week 11+: Burnout**  
Checking email 50x per day. Doubting your skills. Feeling broken. 🚨

## Why This Happens

It's not your fault. It's one of four things:

1. **Spray-and-Pray:** You're applying to 100 jobs with 1-2% response rates. Brutal effort-to-outcome ratio.

2. **No Visibility:** Without tracking where you applied and what stage you're in, anxiety loops forever. You're always wondering "did they respond?"

3. **Obsessive Checking:** Refreshing email 20x per day feels like work. It's not. It's feeding anxiety.

4. **Solo Grinding:** Without accountability, every rejection feels personal. The grind feels isolating.

## The Fix: Systems > Motivation

Here's what I tell people:

**Don't try harder. Build better systems.**

✅ **Pick 10-15 target companies** (not 100 generic ones)  
Target applications get 10-20% response rates vs. 1-2% for spray-and-pray.

✅ **Build a simple spreadsheet**  
Columns: Company | Role | Apply Date | Stage | Next Action Date  
Update weekly. This eliminates 80% of job search anxiety.

✅ **Time-box your search**  
9-11 AM and 2-4 PM only. Then stop. Your brain needs rest.

✅ **Find an accountability buddy**  
Weekly check-ins. Share wins, share struggles. You're not alone.

## The Truth

68 days is **totally winnable.**

But only if you treat it like a 10-week project, not a 10-day sprint.

Most people burn out because they sprint when they should pace.

**Systems beat motivation.  
Consistency beats intensity.  
Community beats isolation.**

## 💬 Your Turn

I want to hear from you:

3. **Have you tried building a job search system?** What worked? What didn't?

Drop your answer in the comments. Let's normalize the 68-day timeline and help each other survive it.
