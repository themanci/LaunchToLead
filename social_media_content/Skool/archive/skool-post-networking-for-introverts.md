🤝 Networking for Introverts: 3 Tips That Actually Work

---

## POST BODY:

Hey everyone 👋

Let's talk about something a lot of you have probably experienced:

**Career fairs make you sweat bullets. Networking events make you want to hide in a corner. Talking about yourself feels painfully uncomfortable.**

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

I was super introverted all through high school and early college. I avoided social situations like the plague. Until I decided enough was enough and I wanted to be more comfortable in professional settings.

Here's what actually worked for me:

## 💪 Tip #1: Practice Makes Progress

Let's be real—you won't magically become an extrovert overnight. That's not the goal.

But you CAN stretch these muscles. You CAN get more comfortable in uncomfortable situations.

**The only way to get better at communicating with people you find intimidating?**

Do it anyway. Repeatedly.

Every awkward conversation is training. Every uncomfortable networking event is a rep at the gym. You're building a skill, and skills require practice.

## 🎯 Tip #2: Set SPECIFIC Goals

Here's where most people fail. They say:

❌ "I want to network more"
❌ "I want to be more social"

That's not a goal. That's a wish.

**Real goals look like this:**

→ "Every week I'll reach out to 5 new people on LinkedIn to expand my network."

→ "Every week I'll go to my professor's office hours at least once to build that relationship."

→ "I'll attend SI sessions at least once a week and exchange contact info with 1 new classmate."

→ "I'll sign up for one new student org and meet 10 new people this semester whose contact info I have."

→ "I'll introduce myself to 1 new person in my dorm every week."

→ "I'll join Toastmasters at my university and start public speaking practice."

Specific targets force you out of your comfort zone. Vague intentions don't.

**Pick one of these (or create your own) and commit to it THIS WEEK.**

## 🔥 Tip #3: Start With Your Passions

Here's the shortcut: it's WAY easier to be social about things you actually care about.

→ **Join clubs that matter to you.** Not just resume-builders—things you genuinely enjoy.

→ **Meet people in contexts you like.** Gaming club, intramural sports, hobby groups, whatever.

→ **Talk about topics that excite you.** Passion makes conversation flow naturally.

When you're talking about something you care about, the social part becomes 10x easier.

## ⚠️ The Reality Check

I need to be honest with you:

If you're in an interview or standing in front of a recruiter, and you're so shy that it's hard to communicate with you...

**How high do you think they'll rank you on "works well with others"?**

Communication skills aren't optional in your career. Networking isn't optional for getting opportunities.

The good news? These are SKILLS. And like any skill, they're learnable. Start small. Be consistent. Watch yourself grow.

## 📝 Quick Recap:

1. **Practice makes progress** — stretch those muscles, do it anyway
2. **Set specific goals** — not wishes, real measurable targets
3. **Start with passions** — it's easier to be social about things you care about
