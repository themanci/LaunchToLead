# Skool Community Post - Master STAR + Lessons Learned

## POST TITLE:

🎯 The STAR Method is Incomplete (Here's What's Missing)

---

## POST BODY:

Hey community 👋

I want to share something that I've noticed with 90% of the coaching calls I do—people are getting interviewed BUT not getting offers.

And it usually comes down to ONE thing.

## The Problem: You're Stopping Too Early

You've probably learned the STAR method for interview questions:

✓ **S** = Situation  
✓ **T** = Task  
✓ **A** = Action  
✓ **R** = Results  

It's solid. You deliver your story, you hit Results, you think you crushed it.

Then the interviewer asks: **"What would you do differently?"**

And suddenly you're scrambling.

---

## Here's What's Missing

The STAR framework is incomplete because it doesn't answer the follow-up question interviewers ALWAYS ask:

**"Did you actually learn from this?"**

When you stop at R (Results), you've told what happened. But you haven't demonstrated:

→ That you reflect on your work  
→ That you're not arrogant (you admit gaps)  
→ That you're coachable and humble  
→ That you actually care about improvement  

These are the qualities that separate people who get callbacks from people who get offers.

## The Fix: Add an L to STAR

**L** = **Lessons Learned** (or: What I'd Do Differently)

This one addition changes everything.

When you end your story with "Here's what I learned" or "Next time, I would approach it by doing X instead," you're telling the interviewer:

**You're reflective. You're coachable. You're confident AND humble.**

That's the person they want to hire.

## How to Execute This

**Step 1: Document the Full Story**  
Write 2-3 paragraphs with ALL the details. Names, dates, numbers, what you were thinking, emotions. Go deep.

**Step 2: Extract the Bullets**  
Boil it down to 5-7 bullet points you can memorize and deliver conversationally in ~2 minutes. NOT robotic.

**Step 3: Practice Obsessively**  
Practice until you can tell this story while thinking about something else. That's how you know it's truly internalized.

**Step 4: Own the Follow-Up**  
When they ask "What would you do differently?"—you already know the answer because you practiced it.

## 🤔 The Reality Check

**Arrogant people** claim they did everything perfectly in their stories.

**Confident engineers** acknowledge what they'd improve.

Guess who gets the offer?

## 💬 Your Turn

I want to hear from you:

1. **Have you practiced STAR stories before?** How did it go?

2. **When interviewers ask "what would you do differently?" how do you normally respond?**

3. **Have you ever added a "Lessons Learned" section to your stories?** If so, what was the impact?

Drop your thoughts below 👇 Let's build on this together and help each other get offers, not just interviews.

## 📌 Key Takeaway

Don't just prepare STAR. Prepare **STARL**.

That L might be the difference between "good interview" and "we're hiring you immediately."
