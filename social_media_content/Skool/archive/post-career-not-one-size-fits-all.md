# Skool Community Post: Career Is Not One Size Fits All

**TITLE:** Stop letting people tell you what you should want

**POST:**

Had to get this off my chest.

There are way too many "gurus" out there presenting their personal preferences as universal truths.

"Working for a corporation makes you a slave."
"Small companies are dead ends."
"Startups are just gambling."
"If you're not building your own thing, you're building someone else's dream."

Here's what they're not telling you: they're projecting.

The reality is much simpler:

🏢 **Big Company** — Stability, predictable schedules, clear roles, established processes, great benefits. Some people genuinely WANT this. And that's completely valid.

🏠 **Small Company** — Wear many hats, more visibility, closer relationships, faster decisions. Some people thrive here.

🚀 **Startup** — Taking something from 0 to 1, high growth potential, high impact. Some people live for this.

💡 **Your Own Business** — Bringing your vision to life, full ownership, unlimited upside (and unlimited accountability). Some people are wired for this.

And here's the part nobody wants to admit:

**Some people would absolutely HATE any of those options.**

That's not a character flaw. That's called being human.

Every single path has trade-offs:
- Pros and cons
- Upsides and downsides
- Things you gain and things you sacrifice

You're not a sucker for working at a Fortune 500.
You're not a sellout for staying at a small company.
You're not reckless for joining a startup.
You're not crazy for starting a business.

You're making the decision that's right for YOU based on what YOU want out of life.

One of my favorite quotes from Jim Rohn:

> "Be a student, not a follower."

Listen to everyone. Learn from everyone. Take in all the information.

Then make YOUR decision based on YOUR values, YOUR goals, and YOUR definition of success.

Career is not one size fits all.
Life is not one size fits all.

Stop following. Start deciding.
