💡 How to sound confident without coming across as arrogant (client Q&A)

## POST BODY:

Hey everyone 👋

Had a great question come up in a coaching session recently that I think a lot of you might be wondering about too:

**"How do I sell myself and sound confident without sounding arrogant and full of myself?"**

This is something so many people struggle with—especially in interviews. You want to stand out, but you don't want to be *that person*.

Here's what I shared:

## 💪 Confidence comes from KNOWING YOURSELF

This is the foundation. If you don't know your stuff, you'll either undersell yourself or overcompensate (which comes off as arrogant).

**How to build genuine confidence:**

→ **Know your projects deeply.** The details, the challenges, the outcomes.

→ **Know YOUR contribution.** Not "we delivered X"—what did YOU specifically do?

→ **Practice out loud.** Repetition makes delivery natural. Confidence isn't faked—it's built.

→ **Believe you belong.** Know that your experiences had impact and that you WILL add value.

When you genuinely know your worth, confidence shows up naturally. You don't have to force it.

## 🤝 Humility comes from HONESTY

Here's where you balance it out so you don't tip into arrogance:

→ **Give credit where it's due.** "My teammate handled the backend while I focused on the integration."

→ **Ask intelligent questions.** Show you're curious and eager to learn. Arrogant people don't do this—they act like they know everything.

→ **Admit what you don't know.** "I haven't worked with that specific tool, but I've used similar ones and would pick it up quickly."

→ **Share failures and lessons.** Talk about what went wrong and what you learned. Arrogant people never admit mistakes.

→ **Talk about how you'd improve.** "If I could do it again, I'd do X differently." This shows growth mindset.

## 🚫 Arrogant vs ✅ Confident

Here's a quick comparison:

| Arrogant | Confident |
|----------|-----------|
| Claims to have "done everything" | Owns their specific contribution |
| Never asks questions | Asks thoughtful questions |
| Takes all the credit | Gives credit to teammates |
| Avoids discussing failures | Shares failures + lessons learned |
| Acts like they know it all | Acknowledges what they're still learning |

## The Key Insight

**Confident people know their worth—AND their limits.**

They own their contributions AND give credit to others.
They share wins AND discuss how they'd improve.

The balance isn't a trick. It's authenticity.
