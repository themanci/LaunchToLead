# Know Your Gaps Before You Get a Coach

## The Pattern I Keep Seeing

I was talking to a friend who coaches engineers at Amazon and Microsoft. She mentioned something that stuck with me:

> "When I ask people what their biggest gaps are, I get silence. They know they're stuck. They know something's wrong. But they can't tell me *what*."

If you can't articulate your gaps, you're not at zero—you're in the **negative**.

You're below the starting line.

## Why This Matters

Coaching isn't magic. A coach can't fix what you can't describe. If you show up saying "I'm stuck" without knowing *why*, you'll spend the first several sessions just figuring out the problem.

That's expensive. That's slow. That's avoidable.

## How to Identify Your Gaps (Before Seeking Help)

### 1. Mine Your Existing Feedback

You probably already have data. You're just not using it.

| Ask Yourself | What to Look For |
|--------------|------------------|
| What keeps showing up in my reviews? | Recurring themes across multiple cycles |
| What do managers tell me to work on? | Specific skills or behaviors they mention |
| What patterns cross multiple jobs? | Issues that follow you from role to role |
| What's the one thing people keep saying? | The feedback you're tired of hearing |

### 2. Push Your Manager for Honest Feedback

Not getting constructive feedback? That's a problem too.

Ask directly:
> "What's one thing I should focus on to get to the next level?"

Make it impossible to dodge. If they can't answer, they're either not paying attention or not doing their job.

### 3. Do a 360° Exercise

Get perspective from every direction:

- **Seniors:** "What would you improve if you were me?"
- **Peers:** "What patterns do you notice in how I work?"
- **Juniors:** "How could I support you better?"

Different perspectives reveal different blind spots.

## Why Most People Skip This

Be honest—which one applies to you?

- ❌ Never ask for feedback in the first place
- ❌ Dismiss feedback as "biased" or "unfair"
- ❌ Hear feedback but don't actually internalize it
- ❌ Scared of what you might learn

The discomfort of feedback now is nothing compared to years of stagnation later.

## The Payoff

When you know your gaps:

✅ Hit the ground running with clear goals  
✅ No wasted sessions figuring out the problem  
✅ Start working on gaps yourself *right now*  
✅ Measure progress against specific areas  
✅ Make coaching actually worth the investment

## Discussion Questions

1. **What's the feedback you keep hearing that you haven't fully accepted yet?**

2. **Have you ever done a 360° feedback exercise? What surprised you?**

3. **If you had to describe your #1 gap right now, what would it be?**

*Don't show up to coaching empty-handed. Know your gaps first.*
