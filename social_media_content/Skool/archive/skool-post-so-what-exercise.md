# The "So What" Exercise: How to Defeat the "What Ifs" Paralyzing Your Career Decisions

## The Coaching Session That Inspired This

I was coaching someone last week who had an offer on the table.

New company. Exciting role. Better opportunity.

But they couldn't pull the trigger.

Their mind was racing with "what ifs":
- What if I get laid off in a year?
- What if the new company isn't stable?
- What if I regret leaving the big company comfort?
- What if the benefits aren't as good?
- What if it doesn't pan out?

Their current employer had everything that felt "safe"—stability, known benefits, room to grow, not much travel. That comfort was keeping them scared of making the leap.

Sound familiar?

## The Problem: We Never Answer the Question

Here's what I noticed: they kept listing these fears, but they never actually *answered* them.

The "what ifs" just hung there—vague, looming, terrifying.

| In Your Head | On Paper |
|--------------|----------|
| Abstract, unknown | Specific, answerable |
| Feels catastrophic | Usually survivable |
| Paralyzing | Actionable |
| Monsters | Manageable problems |

**Abstract fears are monsters. Specific answers are manageable.**

Most people stop at the fear. They never ask: "Okay, but then what?"

## The "So What" Exercise

Here's what I had them do:

### Step 1: Write Down Every "What If"
Get them out of your head and onto paper. All of them. Even the embarrassing ones.

### Step 2: For Each One, Ask: "So What? Then What Happens?"
Don't just acknowledge the fear—ANSWER it. Follow it.

### Step 3: Keep Going: "And Then What? And Then What?"
Don't stop at the first answer. Keep pushing.

### Step 4: Follow the Chain to the Very End
Go all the way until you reach the final conclusion.

## Example: Following the Chain

Let's walk through one fear completely:

**Fear:** "What if I get laid off in a year?"

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| So what? Then what happens? | I'd have to find another job. |
| Do you have an emergency fund? | Yes, 6-9 months of expenses saved. |
| So your family would be homeless? | No, we'd have runway to figure it out. |
| Could you find a job in that time? | Yes, I have marketable skills and a network. |
| Could you go back to your old employer? | Probably, if I left on good terms. |
| **So what's the actual catastrophe?** | **...There isn't one.** |

When you follow the chain to the end, the monster shrinks.

## More Examples to Try

Here are common "what ifs" and how to follow them:

**"What if the new company fails?"**
→ So what? You'd job search again.
→ You've done it before. You can do it again.
→ You'd have new experience and stories to tell.

**"What if I hate the new job?"**
→ So what? You'd start looking for another one.
→ You're not trapped. Jobs aren't prisons.
→ Worst case: you learned what you don't want.

**"What if I regret leaving?"**
→ So what? Regret is information, not a life sentence.
→ You can often go back (boomerang employees are common).
→ Staying and wondering "what if" is also a form of regret.

## What You'll Realize

By the time you reach the final "and then what," you'll see:

✅ You're not going to be homeless  
✅ Your life isn't going to end  
✅ The worst case is survivable  
✅ The fear was bigger than reality  
✅ You have more safety nets than you thought  

**The vague fear is always scarier than the specific answer.**

## Try It Yourself

Take 10 minutes right now:

1. Write down the decision you're stuck on
2. List every "what if" that's haunting you
3. For each one, follow the chain: "So what? Then what? And then what?"
4. Go all the way to the end

Then look at your list. See how small those monsters really are.

## Discussion Questions

1. **What's the "what if" that's been paralyzing a decision in YOUR career right now?**

2. **Have you ever followed a fear to the end and realized it wasn't as bad as you thought?**

3. **What's the scariest decision you made that turned out fine (or even great)?**

*The vague fear is always scarier than the specific answer. Answer your "what ifs."*
