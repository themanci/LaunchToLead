## POST TITLE:

🐉 Interview Storytelling: The "Painting the Pain" Framework (Master This!)

---

## POST BODY:

Hey everyone 👋

I want to share one of the most powerful interview techniques I teach—and it's probably the opposite of what you're doing right now.

**Most candidates rush through their STAR stories.**

They speed through the Situation like it's a boring intro... then wonder why their "amazing results" don't land.

Here's the truth:

## 🐉 The bigger the monster you slay, the bigger the hero you become.

Your results are only as impressive as the problem they solved.

---

## ❌ THE WEAK VERSION:

*"We had a project running behind schedule, so I helped get it back on track..."*

→ No stakes
→ No tension
→ No reason for the interviewer to care

---

## ✅ THE PAINTED PAIN VERSION:

*"Our flagship product launch was 6 weeks behind. The CEO was reviewing our progress daily. Every week of delay cost us $200K in market opportunity. Two team leads had already quit from the pressure..."*

**Same situation. Completely different weight.**

Now when you explain your actions, they actually mean something.

## 🛠️ THE FRAMEWORK: 3 Ways to "Paint the Pain"

### 1️⃣ Quantify the Stakes

Before you explain what you did, make them feel the weight:

→ 💰 Revenue at risk
→ 👥 Customers or users affected
→ 🏢 Team members impacted
→ ⏰ Timeline pressure & deadlines

**Example:** Don't say "tight deadline." Say "3 weeks until we'd lose a $2M contract."

---

### 2️⃣ Show the Tension

Answer these questions in your setup:

→ **Who was watching?** (Executives, clients, board members?)
→ **What was the consequence of failure?** (Lost contract, layoffs, reputation damage?)
→ **Why couldn't the "obvious" solutions work?** (Budget constraints, failed attempts, politics?)

This creates the narrative tension that makes your solution satisfying.

---

### 3️⃣ Create the Contrast

Here's the magic:

→ The **bigger** the problem you describe...
→ The more **impressive** your solution becomes...
→ Without changing a **single fact**.

You're not exaggerating. You're just giving proper context.

---

## 📊 THE MATH

**Most people:** Spend 10% of their story on the Situation → Rush to the solution

**Top performers:** Spend 40% on the Situation → Let the interviewer *feel* the weight first

That 40% is where you build credibility. It's where the interviewer thinks "wow, that sounds really hard."

Then your actions and results become the payoff.

---

## 🎯 YOUR ACTION ITEM

Pick ONE of your go-to STAR stories and rewrite the Situation using this framework:

1. What were the stakes? (Quantify them)
2. Who was watching? (Show the tension)
3. What would have happened if you failed? (Create the contrast)

**Drop your "before and after" in the comments!** I'll give feedback on how to make it even stronger.

## 💡 REMEMBER:

Before you explain what you **DID**...
Make them understand why it **MATTERED**.

🐉 Slay bigger monsters. Become a bigger hero.
