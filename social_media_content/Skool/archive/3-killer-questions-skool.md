**Title:** The 3 Questions I Tell Every Client to Ask at the End of an Interview

---

Hey everyone 👋

This came up in a coaching session this week and I wanted to share it with the community.

My client Osaid asked: **"What kind of questions should I be asking at the end of an interview?"**

Great question — and one I get ALL the time.

Here's the thing: most people ask generic stuff like "What's the company culture like?" or "What do you enjoy about working here?"

Those questions are fine, but they don't help you stand out AND they don't give you useful intel.

Here are the 3 questions I recommend instead:

---

### Question 1: Address Their Concerns Before You Leave

> "Are there any gaps in my qualifications that might make this role more challenging for me?"

This one takes guts. But it's powerful.

You're giving them permission to voice any hesitations — and giving yourself a chance to address them before you walk out the door.

Most candidates leave wondering what went wrong. You'll know exactly what's on their mind.

---

### Question 2: Assess Their Investment in You

> "What does your onboarding or training process look like for someone new to the team?"

This does two things:

1. Shows you're already thinking like an employee who wants to ramp up and contribute
2. Reveals whether they actually have a structured process or just throw people in the deep end

If they stumble on this one or say "we kind of figure it out as we go" — that's a red flag. You might be walking into chaos with no support.

Good to know before you accept an offer.

---

### Question 3: Get Tactical

> "What tools, technologies, or systems will I be working with day-to-day?"

Simple and practical. Shows you're thinking about the actual work.

It also gives you useful info — if they're using tools you've never touched, you'll know what to study up on. If they're using outdated tech, you'll know what you're getting into.

### Why Only 3 Questions?

For a phone screen or first-round interview, 3 solid questions is the sweet spot.

- More than 3 = you risk running over time or seeming difficult
- Less than 3 = you seem unprepared

You're not interrogating them. You're showing intentionality.

### One More Thing (Important!)

Remember — your goal right now is to **secure an offer**.

Once they extend an offer, THAT'S when you can ask as many questions as you want. Grill them on culture, work-life balance, growth paths, management style — leave no stone unturned.

But you can't negotiate or ask tough questions from a position of strength until you have an offer in hand.

**Get the offer first.** There will always be time to ask every question before you accept.

### Your Turn

What's the best question you've ever asked (or been asked) in an interview?

Drop it in the comments — I'm always looking for new ones to add to my toolkit and share with clients.
