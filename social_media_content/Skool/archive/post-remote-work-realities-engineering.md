# Skool Community Post: Remote Work Realities in Engineering

**TITLE:** Dreaming of remote engineering gigs? Here's what nobody tells you.

**POST:**

Let's talk about remote work in engineering — the real version, not the LinkedIn fantasy.

Remote engineering jobs are definitely out there. I know people who've transitioned from on-site roles at power plants and nuclear facilities to fully remote consulting gigs, handling designs for clients nationwide from their home office.

Sounds like the dream, right?

But here's what most people don't tell you:

---

**The in-office environment has something remote can't replicate.**

I call it "osmosis learning."

When you're in the office, you absorb knowledge constantly without even trying:

🏢 Overhearing how a senior engineer troubleshoots a problem
🏢 Getting pulled into a spontaneous whiteboard session
🏢 Having a hallway conversation that turns into a career opportunity
🏢 Watching how decisions get made in real-time

This organic networking accelerates your growth in ways that are hard to measure — but very real.

**Here's the uncomfortable truth about remote work:**

Remote workers often get stuck with the "busywork."

Why? Because managers tend to assign remote employees more independent, low-interaction tasks. Coordinating complex, collaborative work over Slack and Zoom is harder.

The result?

→ In-office folks get the meaty, career-advancing projects
→ Remote folks end up with routine reports and data entry
→ In-office gets the strategic initiatives and decision-making roles
→ Remote gets the independent grunt work

Not always. But often enough to matter.

From my time at John Deere and conversations across my network, I've seen this pattern play out over and over.

**So when DOES remote make sense?**

Remote is ideal when:

✅ You're in a location with limited local opportunities (not everyone lives near a major engineering hub)

✅ You need flexibility for certifications like OSHA, NFPA, or PMP — without micromanagement pressures

✅ You're balancing a side business, family life, or other commitments

✅ You want to avoid rigid clock-in cultures that lead to unnecessary conflicts

For some people, the bandwidth that remote provides is worth more than the accelerated growth of being in-office.

That's a valid trade-off. Just make it intentionally.

**If you go remote, here's how to avoid getting stuck:**

1️⃣ **Schedule regular check-ins** — Don't wait for your manager to reach out. Be proactive.

2️⃣ **Volunteer for cross-functional projects** — Get visibility beyond your immediate team.

3️⃣ **Use real-time communication** — Slack, Teams, quick video calls. Mimic in-office presence.

4️⃣ **Speak up in meetings** — Don't be the quiet box on the screen. Contribute actively.

5️⃣ **Build relationships intentionally** — The hallway conversations won't happen by accident. Make them happen on purpose.

---

**Bottom line:**

Remote engineering jobs exist. They can be great.

But if maximum career growth is your goal — especially early in your career — hybrid or in-office might give you an edge.

If flexibility and life balance are the priority, remote can absolutely work. Just be intentional about staying visible and fighting for the good work.

Know what you're optimizing for. Then choose accordingly.

**Discussion question:**

Are you remote, hybrid, or in-office right now?

What's been your experience with the trade-offs? Have you noticed the "busywork" pattern I mentioned?
