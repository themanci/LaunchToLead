**Title:** Your best interview story might come from a retail job, not your engineering internship.

---

Had a coaching session yesterday that I need to share with you all.

We were doing mock interview practice, and I asked a behavioral question about adapting your communication style for different audiences.

My client hesitated.

"I have an example, but I don't think it counts. It's not really technical..."

The example?

**Training a coworker on the autism spectrum at a previous job to complete a specific task.**

I stopped them immediately.

"That's one of the BEST examples I've heard."

Here's the thing—most people think "adapting communication" means:
- Presenting a project to the marketing team
- Explaining code to a non-technical manager
- "Dumbing down" your capstone presentation

Those work. But they're also what EVERYONE says.

You know what this example showed?

✅ **Real empathy** (not the performative kind)
✅ **Genuine observation** of how someone actually learns
✅ **Adapting without being condescending** (harder than it sounds)
✅ **Patience that comes from caring about the outcome for THEM**
✅ **Real-time adjustment** based on what's working

This demonstrated MORE communication competency than "I presented my senior project to a panel of non-technical people."

Why?

Because it required:
- Observing how someone processes information differently
- Adjusting approach in real-time
- Checking for understanding without being patronizing
- Actually caring if the other person succeeded

**Communication isn't about "explaining things simply."**

It's about connecting with anyone—regardless of how they process information.

Think about an experience you've dismissed as "not technical enough" or "too small" for an interview.

Post it below. I'll tell you if it actually works—and how to frame it.

The example you're hesitant about might be the one that sets you apart.
