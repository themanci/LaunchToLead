📉 Your GPA Is Lower Than You'd Like? Here's How to Mitigate It Honestly

---

## POST BODY:

Hey everyone 👋

Let's talk about something a lot of people stress about—**a GPA that doesn't reflect your true ability.**

First, let me be honest with you:

**Some companies have hard cutoffs.** A 3.0 minimum means a 3.0 minimum. No amount of projects or networking will change that.

But many companies don't enforce these strictly—and for those, you have options.

The goal isn't to hide your GPA or pretend it doesn't exist. The goal is **mitigation, not miracles.**

## 📖 STRATEGY #1: Tell the Transition Story

The jump from high school to college is brutal for many students.

→ 📚 New study methods required
→ 🏠 Living independently for the first time
→ ⏰ No one forcing you to go to class
→ 🔄 GPA damage in early semesters is incredibly hard to recover from

If you struggled early but improved later—**show that growth trajectory.**

**Example:**
*"My cumulative is 2.7, but my last two years averaged 3.4 as I learned how to study effectively."*

This tells a completely different story than just "2.7 GPA."

## 🎓 STRATEGY #2: Use Your Core Engineering GPA

If your major GPA is higher than your overall—use it.

| Overall GPA | Engineering GPA |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 2.8 (dragged down by gen eds) | 3.3 (major courses only) |

**"Engineering GPA: 3.3/4.0"** is 100% legitimate on your resume.

Gen eds like history or philosophy may have hurt your overall, but your core engineering performance tells the real story.

## 🏆 STRATEGY #3: Highlight Specific Wins

Even with a lower cumulative GPA, you probably have bright spots:

→ 🅰️ **A's in tough courses** — Thermodynamics, Controls, Machine Design
→ 🏅 **High scores on capstone or senior design projects**
→ 📊 **Lab reports or projects that exceeded expectations**
→ 🎓 **Dean's List for specific semesters**

These demonstrate you can perform at a high level when it matters.

---

## 🔧 STRATEGY #4: Show Independent Impact

Projects outside of class demonstrate skills your transcript doesn't capture:

→ **Personal projects** — Built because you wanted to, not for a grade
→ **Open source contributions** — Code that got merged into real projects
→ **Hackathons** — 48-hour builds that actually worked
→ **Problem solving** — Things you built to solve real problems

This shows initiative and passion that a GPA never could.

---

## 🤝 STRATEGY #5: Get in Front of Humans

ATS systems filter automatically. Humans can see potential.

→ **Employee referrals** — Often bypass GPA filters entirely
→ **Career fairs** — Face-to-face impressions matter more than numbers
→ **LinkedIn outreach** — Message engineers directly with genuine interest

A human can see your growth story, your projects, your enthusiasm. A bot only sees the number.

## 🎤 IF THEY ASK ABOUT YOUR GPA IN AN INTERVIEW:

Here's a script that works:

*"My freshman year was a struggle adjusting to college-level work and living on my own for the first time. Once I figured out how to study effectively, my last four semesters averaged a 3.4. I also earned A's in [Thermodynamics / Controls / Senior Design] and built a [personal project] outside of class that taught me more than any textbook."*

**The formula:**
1. Own it briefly
2. Show growth
3. Redirect to wins

---

## 📋 THE BOTTOM LINE:

✅ Tell the story of how you **learned and improved**
✅ Use your **core engineering GPA** if it's higher
✅ Highlight **specific wins**—tough classes, great projects
✅ Show **independent work** beyond the syllabus
✅ Get in front of **humans**, not just ATS bots

Will this work every time? No.

But it works more often than you'd think.

💬 **Discussion Questions:**

1. Has anyone here successfully gotten hired below a company's stated GPA requirement? What worked for you?

2. What's your "transition story"? How did you turn things around?

3. What independent projects have you built that you're proud of?
