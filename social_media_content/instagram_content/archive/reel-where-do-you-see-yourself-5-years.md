# Instagram Reel Script: "Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?"

**Target Length:** 90 seconds - 2 minutes  
**Style:** Direct to camera, conversational, energetic

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:05)

"If an interviewer asks you 'Where do you see yourself in 5 years?' — don't say this."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:05 - 0:20)

"Most people say something like: 'I want to be promoted to Senior Engineer' or 'I want to be a manager.'

And look — that's fine. But it's not great.

Here's why."

---

## THE INSIGHT (0:20 - 0:50)

"When you focus on titles and promotions, it sounds like you're just trying to climb a ladder.

But here's the thing — impact and growth should actually BE your goal. Not just something you say to sound good.

If you genuinely focus on:
- Tackling bigger challenges
- Building deep expertise  
- Leading meaningful projects
- Helping others grow

The promotions will come as a RESULT of that.

You're not tricking them. You're telling them what you actually care about."

---

## THE FORMULA (0:50 - 1:30)

"So here's what to say instead.

Break it into three phases:

**Phase 1 — Near term:** 'I want to build deep expertise in [whatever area you're focused on].'

**Phase 2 — Mid term:** 'I want to lead larger projects and take on more ownership.'

**Phase 3 — Long term:** 'I want to mentor others and multiply my impact across the team.'

Put it all together and it sounds like this:

'In 5 years, I want to be tackling bigger technical challenges, growing as a leader, and helping junior engineers develop. I see it happening in phases — first building expertise, then leading projects, then mentoring others.'

See how that's different? No titles. No promotions. Just growth and contribution."

---

## THE CLOSE (1:30 - 1:45)

"And here's the real point:

This isn't just interview advice. This is career advice.

Chase impact. Chase growth. The titles will follow.

If this was helpful, follow for more."
