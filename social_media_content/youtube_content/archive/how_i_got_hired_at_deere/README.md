## Story Beats (From Your Account)

### The Setup
- Working at Iowa DOT as Highway Design Engineer
- Halfway through Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State
- Civil engineering work, but needed mechanical engineering career path
- Previous jobs: movie theater, family grocery/restaurant, limestone quarry, McFarland Clinic IT, CyRide (driver → lane worker → lead), Lowe's CDL

### The Opportunity
- Friend at Deere mentioned the opportunity (NOT involved in hiring)
- Conference in Pittsburgh
- Started preparing resume with Impact Bullet Equation

### The Bet
- Pittsburgh travel NOT paid by Deere
- Borrowed money from a friend
- Wife and two kids, government salary, barely making ends meet
- "Burn the boats" mentality — decided there was no backup plan

### The Preparation
- 15 five-star examples covering all competencies
- 1 week memorizing examples (before work, lunch, after work)
- 1 week mock interviewing (2 per day with DOT colleagues)

### Pittsburgh Interview
- Studied examples constantly: airport, flight, Uber, hotel, conference center
- Panel of 2 (neither were MechE — one in reliability)
- Explained civil engineering examples clearly
- Got positive feedback during interview

### The Interview Binder (Secret Weapon)
- 1-2 page visual aid for each of 15 examples
- Labeled tabs: "Could you turn to tab 4?"
- DOT: highway design drawings
- ISU Research: femtosecond laser experiment diagrams
- Only person in waiting room of ~15 candidates with a binder
- Heard whispers: "That's a really good idea"

### Moline Finals
- Travel paid by Deere
- Hertz didn't save a car (Seinfeld pilot episode reference!)
- Drove own unreliable car instead
- First interview: guy talked 30 mins about himself
- Second interview: went great, binder really impressed (non-engineer)
- Lunch and tour with group

### The Offer
- Week and a half later, phone rang: Waterloo, Iowa
- Started asking questions — launched into STAR instinctively
- "I'm not calling to interview you. I'm calling to offer you a job at John Deere."
- No negotiation for entry level (formula-based), but at high end due to Master's + experience
- Accepted, 2 weeks notice, moved to Waterloo

### The Result
- 5 years in Waterloo with promotions
- Promoted to manager, moved to Quad Cities
- Almost 3 years in Quad Cities
- 8 years total at John Deere
