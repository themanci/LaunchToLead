## 🎬 HOOK (0:00-0:45)

**[GRAPHIC: Black screen with text appearing: "Pittsburgh, PA — 2017"]**

> "I borrowed money from a friend to fly to Pittsburgh for a job interview.
> 
> I had a wife. Two kids. A government job that barely covered the bills. And I was about to go into debt for a *chance* at a better life.
> 
> If I didn't get this job, I'd be paying that money back in small chunks over the next year.
> 
> But I told myself: there is no backup plan. I *will* get this job.
> 
> Today I'm going to tell you exactly how I prepared—the 7 keys that got me hired at John Deere and led to multiple promotions over the last 8 years.
> 
> And the last one—the interview binder—is something I've never seen anyone else do. Stick around for that."

**[Cut to you, direct to camera, sitting]**

## 🎬 WHERE I WAS (0:45-2:30)

**[GRAPHIC: "Iowa DOT — Highway Design Engineer"]**

> "Let me take you back to where I was.
> 
> I was working at the Iowa Department of Transportation in Ames, Iowa as a Highway Design Engineer. I'd been there about a year. At the same time, I was halfway through my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State.
> 
> Now here's the thing—I was doing *civil* engineering work. Highway design. But my degree was in *mechanical* engineering. And I knew that when I finished my Master's, I needed to be positioned for a mechanical engineering role.
> 
> I'd taken the DOT job because I needed *something* engineering-related while I was in school. I didn't want a growing gap on my resume of no engineering experience. But I also knew it wasn't where I was going to build my career."

**[B-ROLL: Highway, Iowa State campus, engineering drawings]**

> "Before this, I'd worked a *lot* of different jobs. Movie theater in high school. My family's grocery store and restaurant for over a decade. I drove haul trucks at a limestone quarry. I set up computers in exam rooms at McFarland Clinic. I was a bus driver at CyRide, then a lane worker servicing buses, then I got promoted to lead lane worker managing others. I even delivered appliances for Lowe's with a CDL.
> 
> But for an engineering job at John Deere? The most relevant experiences were my current role at the DOT, my one engineering internship at a nuclear power plant in Byron, Illinois, and the undergraduate research I did at Iowa State.
> 
> That's what I had to work with."

---

## 🎬 THE OPPORTUNITY (2:30-4:00)

**[GRAPHIC: "The Opportunity"]**

> "A friend of mine who already worked at John Deere reached out to me. He told me about the culture—how Deere really cared about work-life balance, about family, about people. He told me about the technology they were working on. And he mentioned there was going to be a recruiting conference in Pittsburgh.
> 
> Now let me be very clear: my friend was *not* involved in my hiring. He wasn't at the conference. He didn't pull strings. He just made me aware of the opportunity. We both agreed—I wanted to get hired on my own merit, and he wanted me to get hired on my own merit. No conflict of interest.
> 
> So I started preparing."

**[Direct to camera]**

> "And this is where the real work began."

---

## 🎬 KEY #1: THE RESUME (4:00-6:30)

**[GRAPHIC: "Key #1: The Resume — The Impact Bullet Equation"]**

> "The first thing I knew I had to do was completely overhaul my resume.
> 
> I had people in my network review it. And through that process—plus a lot of research—I discovered what I now call the Impact Bullet Equation.
> 
> Every bullet point on your resume needs four elements:"

**[GRAPHIC: 4 boxes appearing one by one]**

> "**Number one: The Accomplishment.** What are you bragging about? Not a duty. Not a responsibility. An *accomplishment.*
> 
> **Number two: The Metric.** How are you measuring it? Give me a number.
> 
> **Number three: How you did it.** What tools, technologies, or methods did you use?
> 
> **Number four: The Business Impact.** What did this mean for your team, department, or company?
> 
> If you combine all four, you get a bullet that makes someone read it and think: *I need to meet this person.*"

**[Direct to camera]**

> "Here's the other thing I learned: if you have less than 7 to 10 years of experience, your resume should be *one page*. Period. Make it easy for someone to grab your resume and understand your impact in 20 seconds.
> 
> And you need to *tailor* it. I had maybe 8 to 10 work experiences I could have listed. But I was going for a mechanical engineering job at John Deere. So I focused on my current engineering role, my engineering internship, and my research. That's what was relevant."

---

## 🎬 KEY #2: THE PHONE SCREEN (6:30-8:00)

**[GRAPHIC: "Key #2: The Phone Screen"]**

> "After I applied, I got a phone screen. And I think a lot of people misunderstand what the phone screen is actually for.
> 
> It's a basic filter. They're checking: Can you communicate clearly? Are you genuinely interested in *this* company? Do your skills roughly match? Are there any deal breakers—like if you absolutely can't relocate?
> 
> They're also gauging the human element. How likeable are you? How easy will you be to work with?
> 
> So here's what I did. I researched specific things about John Deere—technologies they were working on, new products they'd announced. I talked about my family's connection to farming—my dad's side has been farming for generations. I grew up in Iowa, in corn and soybean country, went to school in a small town with farm kids. There was a genuine connection.
> 
> And I focused on *enthusiasm*. On a phone call, that's hard to convey. So I stood up while I talked. I let excitement come through in my voice. I matched their energy while staying professional.
> 
> I passed the phone screen. And I got scheduled for an in-person interview in Pittsburgh."

---

## 🎬 KEY #6: THE BET — BURN THE BOATS (8:00-10:00)

**[GRAPHIC: "Key #6: Burn the Boats" — Black screen, dramatic]**

> "Here's where things got real.
> 
> The interview was in Pittsburgh. John Deere didn't pay for travel for this round. If I wanted to go, I had to pay for the flight, the hotel, the Uber, the food—everything. On my own.
> 
> At this point in my life, I was barely making ends meet. Government job. Two kids. Still paying off debts from school and a car I needed to get to work. Money was *not* piling up around me.
> 
> So I borrowed the money from a friend. No interest—he wasn't a loan shark—but I was going into debt with a friend for a *chance* at this job."

**[Direct to camera — lean in, sincere]**

> "I had a conversation with my wife. We talked back and forth. And we decided: we're taking the shot.
> 
> Because here's what I realized—and this might sound like motivational speaking, but I need you to really hear this:
> 
> If you set a goal and you decide 'I *will* accomplish this—not try, not hope, not have a backup plan—I *will* accomplish this'... it is extremely rare that you don't.
> 
> Tony Robbins has this quote: 'If you want to take the island, burn all the boats behind you.' Meaning—if there's no retreat, you'll find a way to win.
> 
> That was where I put my mind. I told myself: there is no way I don't get this job. Whatever it takes—losing sleep, using vacation days, practicing until I'm sick of my own voice—I will come out on top.
> 
> That was the mindset going into preparation."

---

## 🎬 KEY #3: THE 15 EXAMPLES (10:00-12:00)

**[GRAPHIC: "Key #3: 15 Five-Star Examples"]**

> "Now that I was committed, I had to do the work.
> 
> I went through every experience on my resume—and beyond. I dug into old projects, pulled out metrics and details, and I built what I call my *interview example bank.*
> 
> I did research on the competencies that companies test for in behavioral interviews. Teamwork. Problem-solving. Leadership. Communication. Conflict resolution. These aren't secrets—you can find them with a Google search.
> 
> Then I made sure I had at least 15 examples that I considered *five-star* examples."

**[GRAPHIC: 3-star, 4-star, 5-star pyramid]**

> "Let me explain what I mean.
> 
> A **3-star example** meets the minimum. You answered the question. You demonstrated the competency. Nothing impressive—but you checked the box.
> 
> A **4-star example** shows you went above and beyond. You weren't just assigned a task—you exceeded expectations. Maybe you learned a new tool independently. Maybe you delivered more impact than anyone expected.
> 
> A **5-star example** takes it further. You accomplished everything at the 4-star level, *and* you pushed the impact wider. You documented a process so the next person could do it easier. You trained others. You presented at a department meeting. You spread the benefit beyond your immediate circle.
> 
> I made sure I had 15 of those. Five-star examples. Ready to cover any competency they could ask about."

---

## 🎬 KEY #4: MEMORIZATION (12:00-13:30)

**[GRAPHIC: "Key #4: Memorize Like Your Birth Date"]**

> "Here's where most people fail.
> 
> They think: 'I did the work. I lived it. I'll just talk about it in the interview.'
> 
> No. You need to *memorize* your examples. I mean truly memorize them—like you know your birth date, your Social Security number, how to spell your own name.
> 
> Every metric. Every step. The order things happened. The number of actions you took.
> 
> Why? Because in the interview, you can say: 'There were six actions I took for this. Action one was...' That kind of structure helps the interviewer follow along, document what you said, and justify a higher score later.
> 
> Most people ramble. They forget details. They say 'Oh wait, I should have mentioned...' and jump back and forth in the timeline like a Quentin Tarantino movie.
> 
> I spent *one full week* doing nothing but memorizing my examples. Before work. At lunch. After work. I committed them to memory so completely that I could deliver them without thinking."

---

## 🎬 KEY #5: MOCK INTERVIEWS (13:30-15:00)

**[GRAPHIC: "Key #5: Mock Interview Until It Hurts"]**

> "The next week was mock interviews. Two a day. One in the morning, one after work.
> 
> And here's something people don't appreciate: you don't need an engineer to practice with. You don't need a hiring manager. You don't need someone who's 'been there.'
> 
> Any intelligent human being can sit across from you and tell you: 'That made no sense. You lost me halfway through. You were jumping around.' That feedback is *invaluable*.
> 
> I practiced with friends from the DOT—construction engineers, civil engineers. Not mechanical engineers. Not people who'd be interviewing me. Just people who could give me a gut check on my delivery.
> 
> Because here's the truth I've learned in 8 years of being on the other side of the table: most people *vastly* overestimate how good they are at interviewing. I've seen senior engineers—brilliant engineers—completely bomb interviews because they never practiced.
> 
> Interviewing is a skill. And like any skill, you get better by doing it."

---

## 🎬 PITTSBURGH INTERVIEW (15:00-16:30)

**[GRAPHIC: "Pittsburgh — First Round"]**

> "So I flew to Pittsburgh.
> 
> From the moment I got to the airport, I was studying my examples. On the flight—studying. In the Uber to the hotel—studying. In the hotel room—studying. The next morning, in the Uber to the conference center—studying. Outside the interview room—studying.
> 
> By the time I walked in, I knew my examples better than I knew my birth date.
> 
> The interview was a panel of two people. Neither of them were mechanical engineers—one was in reliability, I think. So I made sure to explain my examples in a way they could understand. I asked questions: 'Are you familiar with this concept?' I brought them along with me.
> 
> After each example, I got positive feedback. They'd smile at each other. They'd say things like 'That really answered the question' or 'Great example.'
> 
> I left Pittsburgh feeling confident. About a week and a half later, I got the call: I was invited to the final round at John Deere headquarters in Moline, Illinois."

---

## 🎬 KEY #7: THE INTERVIEW BINDER (16:30-18:30)

**[GRAPHIC: "Key #7: The Interview Binder" — with binder visual]**

> "This is the secret weapon.
> 
> After Pittsburgh, I started brainstorming with my network. What could I do to set myself apart in the final round?
> 
> And I came up with the interview binder.
> 
> Here's what it was: for every single one of my 15 five-star examples, I created a one-to-two page visual aid. Design drawings. Data analysis. Diagrams of experimental setups. Whatever helped illustrate the example.
> 
> I put them in a binder with labeled tabs. So when I got asked a question, I could say: 'Could you turn to tab four?' And while I told my story, they had something visual to follow along with.
> 
> For my DOT examples, I had highway design drawings. For my Iowa State research—I was doing materials research with femtosecond lasers—I had diagrams of the experimental setup, the target in the chamber, the angles.
> 
> A picture is worth a thousand words. And the binder did something else, too: it showed I had gone *above and beyond*. It showed I was serious. It showed I wanted this more than the other candidates."

**[Direct to camera]**

> "I'll never forget walking into that waiting room in Moline. There were about 15 candidates there. When I pulled out my binder and started flipping through it, I heard people around me whispering: 'That's a really good idea.' 'I wish I'd thought of that.'
> 
> Nobody else had one.
> 
> My confidence went through the roof."

---

## 🎬 MOLINE FINALS (18:30-20:30)

**[GRAPHIC: "Moline — Final Round"]**

> "Quick funny story before the interview.
> 
> This round was paid for by John Deere. They booked me a rental car from Des Moines. But when I got to the Hertz counter, they told me: 'We have your reservation. We just didn't save a car.'
> 
> I literally said to the person: 'Have you ever seen the pilot episode of Seinfeld?' Because that's *exactly* what happened. Jerry goes off about how the whole point of a reservation is to *hold* a car.
> 
> Anyway, I wasn't going to risk waiting until morning. So I drove my own unreliable car to Moline and got reimbursed for mileage."

**[Direct to camera — lighter tone]**

> "The interview was two separate one-on-ones. The first one, the interviewer spent 30 minutes talking about himself. I was watching the clock thinking: we have 50 minutes for questions and we haven't started. But I stayed polite, answered the questions I could, used my binder. Got good feedback.
> 
> The second interview went even better. We spent only 5-10 minutes on intros and jumped in. This interviewer was *really* impressed by the binder—especially because they weren't an engineer. The visual aids helped them understand my examples completely.
> 
> After interviews, we had lunch as a group, did a tour of headquarters, and I drove back to Ames to wait."

**[GRAPHIC: Phone ringing animation]**

> "About a week and a half later, I was at my desk at the DOT. My phone rang. The caller ID said Waterloo, Iowa.
> 
> I went to a conference room and answered.
> 
> The person on the phone started asking me questions—they sounded like interview questions. And I just *launched* into my STAR format instinctively. Situation, task, action—
> 
> And he interrupted me.
> 
> He said: 'Let me just clarify—I'm not calling to interview you. I'm calling to offer you a job at John Deere.'
> 
> That moment—relief, excitement, trying not to freak out on the phone—I'll never forget it."

**[Direct to camera — smiling]**

> "I asked about negotiation. He said for entry level, it's formula-based—take it or leave it. But because I had work experience plus a Master's degree, I was at the higher end of the range. It was competitive. Way better than my DOT salary.
> 
> I accepted. Put in my two weeks. Moved to Waterloo. Spent 5 years there, got promoted along the way, then got promoted to manager and moved to the Quad Cities where I've been for almost 3 years now."

## 🎬 THE 7 KEYS RECAP (20:30-21:30)

**[GRAPHIC: "The 7 Keys" summary card]**

> "So let me recap the 7 keys that got me hired:"

**[Each key appears on screen as you say it]**

> "**One:** The Impact Bullet Equation—Accomplishment, Metric, How, Business Impact. Make your resume impossible to ignore.
> 
> **Two:** The Phone Screen Strategy—research the company, show genuine enthusiasm, make a real connection.
> 
> **Three:** Build 15 five-star examples that cover every major competency.
> 
> **Four:** Memorize those examples like you know your birth date. One week of intensive practice.
> 
> **Five:** Mock interview until it hurts. Two a day. With *anyone*.
> 
> **Six:** Burn the boats. Decide you *will* get this—not try, not hope—*will*.
> 
> **Seven:** The interview binder. Visual aids for every example. The secret weapon that set me apart."

---

## 🎬 MENTORSHIP & CTA (21:30-22:30)

**[Direct to camera — warm, sincere]**

> "One last thing I need to say.
> 
> Since getting hired at Deere, I've had so many people mentor me. Friends, colleagues, people way further along in their career who took time to teach me—how to lead, how to communicate, how to set goals and accomplish them.
> 
> Anyone who says they got somewhere by themselves is either lying to you or lying to themselves. We all stand on the shoulders of giants.
> 
> And I've tried to pay that forward. That's why I started Launch to Lead—to help engineers land their first job, their next job, their dream job. To share the methods and frameworks that worked for me and the hundreds of people I've coached over the years.
> 
> If you want personalized help—someone to look at *your* resume, *your* examples, *your* situation—there's a link in the description to book a free strategy call.
> 
> If this video helped you, subscribe. I'm going to keep making content like this.
> 
> And drop a comment below: what's the biggest obstacle in your job search right now? I read every single one.
