OK I want to go ahead and do a complete brain dump on how I got hired at John Deere 8 years ago. At the time I was hired I was working at the Iowa DOT in Ames Iowa . And I have been working there for around one year and during that time I was working on my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. At this point I had been out of my bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering at Iowa State for around two years I had a gap year in between graduating from Iowa State and working on my master's degree for a year and then I got hired at the Iowa DOT about a year later in and at this point now I've been at the Iowa DOT for one year and I'm about halfway through my master's degree at Iowa State and Mechanical Engineering . At this time the reason that I took my job at the Iowa DOT was because I was really looking for any engineering opportunity that I could get a hold of while I was working on my master's degree and I wanted to find something that was local to Ames Iowa I was living there at the time and I was going to class on campus so I wanted something that would keep me close by geographically but something that could be at least engineering related that way I wasn't just working somewhere without my degree and letting that gap on my resume of no engineering experience grow and grow and grow while I was doing my master's degree. After about a year a guy with DOT while I was doing civil engineering and construction engineering type of engineering work I started to realize that I really needed to start thinking about finding something closer to my degree of mechanical engineering and they wanted to start thinking about lining something up for when I finished my mechanical engineering master's degree the following year So I started putting some feelers out and trying to understand what opportunities were out there and what types of positions that I would be qualified for and I wanted to start getting things ready for that . 

Now at this point I had a friend of mine reach out to me who already was working at John Deere and suggested that I give John Deere some thought and I got some good advice from him about the culture at John Deere the types of products that they work on the location at least that he was working at and I got a sense that John Deere as a company had a really good culture and they really cared about people in terms of family people's commitment to family and to work in terms of flexibility with time off for example in terms of just work culture in general where things weren't super super super high pressure and high stress but it was still stimulating and challenging and they've been kind of breaking into new technologies and they're obviously a leader in their market in terms of market share but also just in terms of a technological advancement and interesting new technologies that they're working on within the large AG industry . So I started looking into John Deere as a potential opportunity to seek employment and one of the first things I knew I had to do was review my resume so a couple of folks in my network help me to review my resume take a look at things and this is where a lot of the heavy lifting initially started in just in terms of getting my resume polished up and looking attractive to potential employers hiring managers recruiters etc. This is a place too I could focus on what I call now in my methods the impact bullet equation umm and basically fundamentally but I think I really discovered in all my research with people in my network and online in terms of what makes an impactful bullet point and now I have kind of the benefit of being a hiring manager and hiring people and reviewing a lot of resumes over the eight years of my career at John Deere but this still kind of holds true and it's what I tried to do back when I was getting hired myself really there's 4 elements that I think are important to include in a resume bullet that I included in mine and that I think are very helpful for people today still who are applying for positions within the engineering world and outside the engineering world and that is that each bullet point should really address number one what is the accomplishment that you're bragging about what is the accomplishment that you're putting on your resume here to highlight for whoever is looking at your resume Number two is what is the metric by which you are measuring that accomplishment for that bullet point in your resume Number three is how you accomplish that so it could be just in terms of what you did to accomplish it but even better than that could be any kind of tools and technologies that you use to accomplish that thing so #4 would be the business impact so if you're doing something at least in an internship or a company what was the impact to the business what was the impact to your department what was the impact to your company that doing this thing had so if you combine all four of those elements together you end up having a much more impactful bullet point that really highlights the overall impact of what you did . 

So I ended up going through my resume and at this point in time I had two main professional experiences that actually I think would stand out and be meaningful towards an engineering job at John Deere and that was the role that I was currently in at the time which was a highway design engineer for the Iowa DOT And the other was my sole internship experience which was a programs engineering intern for a nuclear Power point a nuclear power plant in Illinois in Byron Illinois And I stayed in Rockford IL during that internship . Up to this point I had a lot of other experience on my resume or at least in my work history at before this I'd worked a ton of different jobs I worked in a movie theater outside of high school I worked in a family grocery store and restaurant business for 10 10 to 15 years I had worked in a limestone mine for a while I worked at Mcfarland Clinic in Ames Iowa helping with the BIT department to set up computers and exam rooms I had worked at the Cyride the the City Transit system in Ames for Iowa State University It's actually for the city of Ames it's kind of associated with Iowa State universities mostly students that ride the bus but I'd worked there as a driver as a lane worker where I would service the busses when they come back from service at the end of the day and I was promoted also to lead lane worker so I had some responsibilities managing the lane workers as well as a lot of building maintenance type responsibilities at that position I had delivered appliances for Lowe's as ACDL as a class BCDL driver So I had a bunch of different jobs but at this point I felt like the most relevant jobs that I could talk about on my resume were the ones at the Iowa DOT and the Internship I also had some experience on my resume doing some undergraduate research with a few different professors at Iowa State that I also thought would lend themselves well to hiring manager or recruiter for this applying at John Deere situation . So I think an important thing to highlight here is that it's important to list your experience on your resume keep put things on your resume that are the most relevant to what you're trying to accomplish with your resume so this is a question that I get a lot from people i've had questions like you know how many bullets should I have per job experience how many job experiences should I have per page you know what order should I list them the key thing to focus on is if you're still you know with let's say less than less than seven to 10 years of experience you probably only should have one page of your resume so if you're coming out of college for sure you should be at one page make it easy for someone to grab your resume and understand your experiences in one page and then you just really want to understand what you're applying to with your resume So what you're hoping to accomplish with your resume and you know cater your experiences to that right I had probably I don't know seven or eight to 10 work experiences that I could have listed on my resume but if I'm going for an engineering job at John Deere I really want to focus on my current engineering position I want to focus on my engineering internship I want to focus on my undergraduate research with the mechanical engineering department right Even though I think there are some valuable lessons and some things I could have brought to the interview or to my resume from being a manager at Cyride there's things that could have brought from managing my dad's meat locker for a couple of years managing the above ground plant at the Limestone mine but they're just not as applicable to engineering work or an engineering job as the engineering experience right so somewhat subjective there but the advice really I'm giving is cater your resume towards put on your resume what you think is the most relevant to what you're trying to accomplish with your resume what you're applying for. 

So I spent quite a bit of time going through my resume trying to beef up my bullet points using my what I call my Impact Bullet Builder formula Again this is the accomplishment the metric that it's measured by how you accomplished it in the business impact that it had towards whatever group or whatever company department whatever team you're operating in So I went through all my bullet points and I really II vamp them up with regard to my impact equation and at this point it felt like I had a solid resume to be able to start applying for positions that I knew were open at John Deere and I also was made aware that there was going to be a conference in Pittsburgh where if I got an interview there I'd have to attend in person I would have to fly out on my own money in my own budget fly out there and interview for an entry level position at John Deere and that was told to me by my my friend who currently worked at John Deere. So I want to be clear my friend was not at the conference I wasn't interviewed by my friend at all you know I was just really made aware of the opportunity by my friend who already worked there and was you know giving the thumbs up about enjoying working at John Deere and the culture there you know there was no like what you would think like buddy buddy I just sent him my resume and somehow I got to the top of the pile and you know we were pretty in strong agreement too about that where I don't want that to be the case and he didn't want that to be the case I mean not that it's even possible but I wanted to get hired on my own merit he wanted me to get hired on my own merit none of us wanted any conflict of interest so he was not involved in my hiring process at all And I went to the conference I knew I'd have to go to the conference there he wouldn't be there recruiting it would be other people they recruiting but I was just made aware of that opportunity by him . 

O at this point I had enough experiences and things on my resume that stood out where I applied I ended up at this point landing a phone interview which was something that John Deere does before an in person interview at these conferences is a phone screen and a couple key comments I guess they mentioned about the phone screen number one I think it's important that people understand what the purpose of the phone screen really is .  So the phone screen is a basic filter and really what they're looking for here is can you communicate clearly are you genuinely interested in this specific company do your skills roughly match U with what they're looking for and are there any really big deal Breakers you know before someone goes and travels to a conference before someone goes and travels for an on site interview let's say for example a candidate said hey I you know there's absolutely no way I can relocate to Waterloo Iowa where John Deere has some jobs well be a good thing to know before everybody both sides waste their time interviewing when you know that there's no way you know that you're ever going to relocate there and that's the only position they're interviewing for So to kind of flush some of those things out the other part of the phone screen to think about too is you know they're trying to Gage the human element right sometimes there are some some technical questions maybe in a phone screen that other companies I didn't have any at my in my interview in John Deere there were no technical engineering questions They're really just also to see the human element you know how maybe likable are you how easy is it going to be to work with you how is it going to be to communicate with you so some of the key things I really tried to do here while I was doing the phone screen were get some specific things about John Deere that I was interested in so I did some research about umm some of the technologies that John Deere was working on some of the new things that have been published publicly that John Deere has been bringing to the market my connection my family's connection to farming my dad's side of my family has been in farming for many generations so there's some connection there I myself grew up in the Midwest I grew up in Iowa in you know corn and soybean central here grew up on an acreage went to school in a small town with a lot of farm kids so there's some kind of a connection there as well to the land and the culture of what the company stands for And another key thing I really tried to you want to try to breakthrough into the phone interview is enthusiasm . It's a lot harder I mean the phone interview that I had was literally on the phone I don't know now if a lot of companies do like quote unquote an initial phone screen but with like a zoom call or a teams call or something but I think they still do them on the phone a lot even in John Deere so you're one of the hard things to accomplish there is to convey your enthusiasm while you're on a phone call right so one of the easy hacks people tell you to do is to stand up when you're on the call I did that as well but you really want to just show through your voice your tone your answers the questions you do you want to show excitement right you want to show interest a person on the other end of the phone is trying to Gage you as a person are you interested are you excited Is this you know just you're looking for any opportunity and you're just going through the motions or you're really excited about what this company has to offer what they work on what the product is their culture and are you really excited about them in in particular and do you communicate well do you show genuine enthusiasm you know trying to match you know their energy level as the person on the phone screen while being professional and personable so you're trying to accomplish all that in the phone screen . OI got through my phone screen and I was notified shortly thereafter that I was scheduled for an interview in Pittsburgh And this is kind of where the story gets interesting. 

So I have two kind of things going through my mind right now number one I've gotten my resume together with a lot of my experiences that I'm proud of and I'm trying to communicate out to people But I know now that for the interview I really need to be prepared for behavioral based questions and a lot of these interview examples that I'm going to use for the behavioral based questions are going to come from a lot of the examples that I've listed on my resume right the resume is more of like A teaser taster appetizer now I need to work to really provide a lot more detail for all of these interview examples and I'm going to have to dig through my past i'm going to have to dig through old projects to pull out metrics and details and specifics about all these examples that I'm going to use that are going to build on the bullet points that I already have in my resume but they're going to go into a lot more depth when I get into the interview . So that's issue number one issue number two is I know it's in Pittsburgh PA and you know John Deere didn't pay for that travel so if you get an interview all the travels on you so I had to pay for airfare had to pay for a hotel had to pay for Uber had to pay for food everything to go there take time off from work because that's not happening on a weekend And this at this point in my life was really quite a financial commitment so at this point I was working at the Iowa DOT A government job I wasn't making a ton of money I had I was married at the time and I had two kids at the time so you know money was not abundantly flowing everywhere piling up around me I still had some debts and things I was working on paying off from school and from like a vehicle that I had to purchase to be able to have reliable transportation to and from work So I was just kind of getting my feet under me with this job at the DOT making ends meet but really didn't have a lot of extra money to be playing around with so it was a considerable financial commitment on my end . And actually to stress kind of how much of a financial commitment was on my end I ended up borrowing the money for the trip the plane ticket and the hotel that I had to reserve in the in the Uber from a friend of mine with the hopes that if I land this job I will be able to pay them back and if not I'll have to just pay them back in small chunks over the next let's say 6 to 12 months . 

So I think this is an important part of the story to stop and pause and mention a couple of things number 11 of the things that I really learned in the past eight years nine years since this experience is something that kind of might sound a little bit like a motivational speaking point but I really encourage especially young people to to give some thought to this and and really pay attention and think about what I'm about to say here I had no guarantee that going to Pittsburgh and spending all this money that I didn't really have to go seek a better opportunity was going to pan out and after discussion with my wife we talked back and forth about it You know basically I'm borrowing some money from a friend sure there's no interest he's not like a loan shark was gonna come and like bust my kneecaps at some point if I don't pay him back but am going into debt with a friend privately with no interest or anything but taking on some more debt knowing that if I don't land this job it's going to just put us in a worse financial situation for six to 12 months and the key thing here really is that I just believed that I would be able to land this job you know I reached the point where I felt confident enough in my experiences and I felt like as long as I get this opportunity to interview I'm going to be able to prove that I belong here i'm going to be able to land you know what I considered a real mechanical engineering job at a top mechanical engineering company you know I've been going to career fairs my whole time at Iowa State and John Deere is always the premier employer people are lined up around the wrapped around Hilton Coliseum for their booth and for those job opportunities you know in our classes knowing that professors are doing joint research programs with John Deere you know it's a premier employer for Mechanical Engineers in the entire Midwest And I felt like if I have this opportunity I really don't want to look back 2030 years from now and say ah what would life be like if I would have just taken that shot and borrowed that money and got on that plane to Pittsburgh and went and you know tried my best at that interview so which in my wife and myself we both decided to take a shot and see if we can make the best out of it. 

So all that to say at that time I didn't really know how to maybe vocalize it or spell it out but one of the things I've come to believe since then is that if you set a goal for yourself and you set a target and you can think to your own life and to the own events of your life and others you know I would venture to bet that it is extremely extremely rare if you comb through your Rolodex of memories Think about a time when you set a goal where you set the goal and you decided like I am going to accomplish this I'm not going to try to accomplish this I'm not going to tell myself that if I don't accomplish it this is going to be my back up plan like you literally set a goal and you say like I will not accept anything else but to accomplish this I will accomplish it it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when . You know one of the great quotes I love by Tony Robbins famous personal development speaker is he always says you know if you want to take the island just burn all the boats behind you right meaning if you know you and your army you know there's no retreat if you lose this battle you basically die Then you'll take the island right if you know there's no other alternative once you know there's a way to retreat intrinsically your motivation will be less so I got myself in this mental state for this job and and take borrowing some money at a kind of a lower point in my life financially to travel to Pittsburgh for a chance to get this job that I put that in my mind like the same way as burning the boats like I told myself there is no way I don't get this I have whatever it takes whatever I'm going to have to do however much interview practice however much I'm going to have to dig through and find details on projects like whatever I have to do if I have to lose sleep if I have to use vacation days at work if I have to you know whatever it is I will come out on top having accomplished this that was the mindset going into this next phase of preparation . 

So now that the commitment commitment was there and I know I had the date I was a couple weeks away from attending this conference and going to my scheduled interview there my first round interview now came the work . O at this point I went through all my examples that I had on my resume and added in addition to that any examples I could think of that would be impressive in an interview and I started doing some research on what are some of the basic competencies that companies will use in the behavioral based interview to test candidates competencies right what are the general competencies that companies will use In googling this you can find there's a pretty generic list of 10 to 15 to 20 competencies that pretty much cut across most companies and most behavioral based interviews So finding these resources out there and what the competencies are what types of questions they would ask from those competencies it isn't you know super top secret government clearance needed held secrets right it's it's out there really for anybody who just wants to do a Google search so the key really is not . 

So I made sure after going through all my examples and all my experiences from my current job at the Iowa DOT as a highway design engineer my engineering internship experience as a programs engineering intern at a nuclear power plant and my research that I did at Iowa State in the mechanical enduring department that I had around 15 examples that I considered to be five star interview examples And when I say 5 star interview examples what I mean is anything under 3 star is unacceptable it's like a disqualifier in terms of you being hired being considered a candidate so if you have 12 star example that basically means this person shouldn't be considered any longer as a candidate 3 star OK This person meets the minimum requirements nothing too impressive here nothing to write home about or be too excited about but they answered the question they demonstrated the basic competency level you know they checked the box. The four star interview example is going above and beyond so you know you were assigned something you were assigned some tasks some situation came up how did you go above and beyond what you were asked to do in accomplishing that task above and beyond what the average person would do could be in terms of impact in terms of effort in terms of overcoming obstacles in terms of learning some new tool or program or piece of knowledge independently that you would have to go and learn to accomplish this thing so it's about going above and beyond. In a five star example is having accomplished everything from the 3 star and 4 star level but now pushing impact to a wider audience or improving the process that a person after you comes to do the same thing can do it easier or more efficiently or faster or transferring that knowledge training others in different teams different groups other departments so it's about accomplishing what you would accomplish in a 3 or four star example but now you're kind of broadcasting pushing that benefit pushing that impact pushing that positive improvement that you made to a wider audience it could be your entire team presenting at a department meeting creating some new process documentation that would help others in the future sharing it with other teams other departments other groups pushing that influence beyond the circle of influence that you kind of started the project with or set out to do the task with in the 1st place. 

So now that I had 15 solid examples of the kind I'm speaking about I had about a week where I went through and every day before work on my lunch break after work I was memorizing those examples so the key thing here is I think a good place to pause and really reflect on and give some advice on is most people don't spend enough time memorizing their examples to the point where they know them like the back of their hand or they know them like their own birth date or Social Security number or how to spell their own name right it's very very important to go through memorize your examples mean just memorize them truly to the definition of the word memorize you should know all the metrics all the steps what order things happened you should be able to memorize how many actions you took for this example so that when you're in the interview for example you can say you know why you're giving the example you can say there's there's six actions I took for this example action #1 was XYZ action #2 so even when you memorize them well enough to know the number of actions then it helps to foreshadow how many actions you have to give for that example which makes it easier for the person listening to your interview interviewing you to document things which makes it easier for them to give you a higher score and justify it later because they've documented it right so most people don't take enough time to truly memorize their examples and they kind of feel like well I'm the one who did the work I'll know about it I'll just be able to get to the interview and talk about it And they end up either giving missing some details missing some important parts or they end up you know halfway through the example they go oh wait I forgot to tell you during like kind of the setup phase I should have mentioned that this thing happened or this was a constraint so they're going back and forth and forward and backward and kind of like Quentin Tarantino in their example where they tell the beginning at the they tell the end at the beginning and the beginning at the end just spend enough time I think a week is plenty to memorize the examples in all their excruciating detail so they're committed to memory and now you're just pulling from them you're just regurgitating them Same way that you memorized math facts and you memorized your multiplication tables and your you know state capitals when you were in element middle school you just have to commit them to memory 

O after I was done with this for one week the next week was mock interviewing and I don't want to sound like a broken record but this is kind of the same situation I think in my experience now in the past eight years I think that one of the most under you know prepared types of things that people do is just not mock interviewing enough and overall I think from what I've seen the past 8 years I've been now on the side of the interviewer on the table many many many many times i've interviewed myself many more times helped many many many colleagues people i've coached people in my network to prepare for interviews and I did think across the board one of the biggest deficiencies I think I can point out is that most people vastly vastly vastly underestimate how much they should be mock interviewing and how good their interviewing skills are so I've seen this even at the senior engineer staff engineer level that I've helped to fill positions for that engineers that I've worked with and I know are really good engineers and when they interview they're just absolutely terrible it's almost embarrassing to even go and like think that this person is so good in real life at their job but they're interviewing is terrible so the problem with that is you might be A really good engineer in real life but if you're interviewing with people who don't know you and don't know your skills they're just going to go on what they saw in the interview and if the interview sucks and it's terrible that's what they're going to assume right nobody's going to interview somebody and think oh man they bombed the interview but there are really really good engineer I mean yeah you might have some really experienced managers and people they might really know that hey this is possible but if you're interviewing against three other candidates and one of them knocked the interview out of the park why would that hiring team if they don't know you even give you the benefit of the doubt and go hey we got this guy over here who interviewed like a rock star but we're going to hire the guy who sucked because he might be a really good engineer right doesn't make any sense so most people vastly under and vastly overestimate how good they are interviewing most people suck at interviewing It's just a fact i've seen it so many times it's hard to even remember how many times I've seen it So I spent about a week doing mock interviews two a day full interviews one in the morning one after work and another point to pause and maybe and add here I think a lot of people also undervalue Just having anybody to help them prepare for interviews right a lot of people think they have to have an engineer they have to have an engineering manager they have to have somebody who knows about interviewing a lot They need somebody who's interviewed people for companies they need somebody who's like a stellar interviewer themselves Those would be great I mean if you have access to that that's really good but I also think there's incredible value that people don't really give credit to for just having any human being sit across from you and practice interviewing like that is exponentially more beneficial than just sitting there and looking at your notes by yourself quietly because it at least forces you to say it out loud to deliver it as though you're delivering it to a team an interview panel and it forces you to be in that mode of interviewing right it's like how even practicing a speech is better to practice it out loud alone in the room than to just read your speech off the paper right And beyond that I think as long as you have somebody who has some baseline level of intelligence and is somewhat intelligent human being they don't have to be an engineer or an or an engineering manager but they can follow through your example And they could be a good baseline about if if it was easy to track your example and follow along with what you were saying right if they tell you hey I was completely lost I had no idea what you were talking about that's not a good sign right sure there might not be a technical person but you should be able to deliver your interview example in an interview I mean unless you're going for some like super senior staff level and position or something very complex but for an entry level position you should be able to communicate that example in a way that your grandmother understands and if you can't do that you're probably not explaining it basically enough right so they can still give you like a gut check and a reality check about if your flow is good is your speed good is your tone good are you speaking clearly Did it make sense did you go through the example in chronological order did you jump around a lot did you skip around a lot back and forth through the timeline you do miss some important parts with some was there some important context you know they can ask you basic questions about context and you can go Oh yeah I should have included that in my example that's a good piece of context I should include right so they can still ask you some like basically intelligent questions that can still improve your interview performance so undervalue just having anybody right I used a couple of friends from work do we were they were in construction engineering type of jobs right at the DOT or civil engineering and most of my examples were in their wheelhouse but I was still preparing for like A mechanical engineering type of job so it doesn't always have to line up and match up having somebody is better than nobody having somebody more qualified is better than unqualified of course but don't undervalue just having somebody across from you it's very very very valuable . 

So after all this preparation I was ready to go I ended up taking some time off of work and flying out to Pittsburgh I know basically from the time that I was scheduled to leave I mean at the airport basically waiting for my flight to leave to Pittsburgh I was studying my interview examples reviewing them practicing them making sure they're committed to memory all the metrics all the numbers every detail the whole entire flight I was studying my interview examples the whole entire time from the airport the Uber ride to my hotel I was studying my interview examples And the whole entire time at my hotel I was studying my interview examples so I went to bed I woke up in the morning hours before the interview I was studying my examples on the Uber ride from my hotel to the Conference Center I was studying my examples at the Conference Center outside the interview hall I mean I was just reviewing those examples and studying them to the point where I probably knew them better than I knew my birth date So at that point when things are so committed to your memory and and I know a lot of people can push back on this and say well you should just be able to go to interview and be yourself and you know show that you know how to problem solve and it just is not true people who say that just haven't been in an interview interviewing itself is a skill right you can be the smartest person on earth and suck at interviewing because interviewing itself is not about problem solving for a behavioral based interview you aren't problem solving in the interview right if you're talking about a coding interview a technical coding interview for example at a FANG company yeah the goal of that interview is to see how you problem solve and that's why usually they give you problems that can't be solved by you in the interview to see how you would go about it to see how you would talk to the interviewers as if they were your teammates to get more information and you know work through the problem but a behavioral based interview like the one I went through it's a lot about delivery and showing how you solve problems in the past it isn't so much about solving the problem in real time right now in front of the interviewers right so memorizing your examples and how you performed in the past is very very very very crucial to performing well in these kind of behavioral based interviews. So after so much preparation I finally got to the point where it was my interview time I went into my interview I introduced myself to the 2 interviews it was a panel of of two interviewers Right away we kind of broke the ice by talking about my experience most of my experience I'd be talking about with Civil Engineering based at the DOT They were both non they weren't even Mechanical Engineers I don't think both the ones I interviewed with one of them was more like in reliability I forget what the other 1 was in but that was kind of a big talking point in the beginning and throughout the interview they appreciated how I really explained the the civil engineering type of examples I had to make them understandable and that's another key point to kind of focus on a little bit too if you get to know the people at the beginning of the interview and you know that you're not from the same domain really professionally you know tone down your jargon that you use that's specific to your domain try to make sure it's understandable try to ask questions you know in a non condescending way like does that make sense are you familiar with you know this concept are you familiar with that concept if they say no OK explain it a little bit before you give your example making sure you're kind of bringing these people in the interview on the journey with you and you have these checkpoints where you see if they understood what you said before you continue on right you don't want to you give the whole example and it's like let's say it's like you know whatever 20 points and they got lost on point number two and now you want 18 more points and they're like lost as hell right not a good place to be so that helped a it was all behavioral based questions answered all of them I felt like it went well I got good feedback in the interview after each example I gave both interviewers tended to like kind of smile at each other and and tell me in some way like you know that was a good example or hey that really answered the competency that really answered the question well a great example or that's kind of what we're looking for here for this question stuff like that so I got really good positive feedback in vibes during the interview things feel like they went really well so wrapped up the interview and ended up leaving that conference hall in Pittsburgh back to my hotel room to get catch my to go back for my flight 

So I took my flight back to Iowa and it was about a week and a half I want to say a week and a half to two weeks that I heard back that I passed that interview around and that I was scheduled now for the final round of interviews which would be happening at John Deere headquarters in Moline Illinois . At this point I did some brainstorming now with a couple people in my network and one of my friends the friend who told me about the position at John Deere about what I could do to kind of set myself apart for this round of interviews and I ended up coming up with this idea with the help of my friend who already worked at John Deere of bringing an interview binder with me to the final round of interviews so a little bit of a pause here on this So what this really is is trying to understand now my 15 5 star examples that I have I want to have a visual aid in a binder for every single example so this doesn't have to be 3456 pages the best thing really is like one page maybe two pages some kind of visual aid about each example so the idea is every single interview example that I'm going to give that I have in my you know my lexicon of any of your examples has some visual aid 1 to two page in my binder and I have those those sheets that have the labels on the edge of them so I hand the binder over at the beginning of the interview and when I when I get asked a question tell me about a time when XYZ happened I can pick my example and say 0 could you turn to tab #4 right they turn to the 4th tab OK I want to tell you about a time when I was working on this project blah blah blah blah and they can see in front of them whether that be some design drawings it could be some data analysis that you did for that whatever helps demonstrate and illustrate that example You know in the sentiment of like a pictures worth 1000 words and this helped me out quite a bit too because I had a lot of examples from the DOT where it was like highway design right there's a lot of kind of design elements there's a lot of like draw UPS and mock ups and you know design drawings for for highway design projects that I was doing at the DOT that helped it also helped with the Iowa State research right there was a lot of research I was doing with like new material type of development in the mechanical engineering department that was using some femto 2nd lasers you know doing some ablation on a target in a chamber so showing the diagram of the setup how the target is set up in this chamber what the angle is that the laser is coming in at and there's a gas inside that chamber it's it's you know having a reaction with the stuff that's getting ablated off of the target having some visual diagrams for a lot of examples can be very very helpful give it can give the interviewer something to look at to visualize try to understand what the example is talking about better than just you describing it in words right and the other big thing that the interview binder does I think too is just shows the interviewers too that you've gone above and beyond right I think it's pretty rare for people to show up to an interview with this at this level of preparation So it's a visual aid for them but it's also showing that hey this person you know most people aren't even memorizing their examples like you memorized your examples you practice interviewing way more than everybody else and now you've got this visual aid with you it just shows like man this person is freaking serious like they've gone above and beyond way above and beyond normal to re for this interview which shows that they care a lot it shows that they're taking it very seriously it shows they want the opportunity right it shows all the reflects a very very very highly in a lot of non technical ways on your part to come with this kind of preparation. 

So so funny story when I was supposed to go so the actual final round of interviews in Moline was paid by John Deere so travel was supposed to be paid they booked a Hertz rental car from Des Moines to travel to Moline hotel is paid food is going to be reimbursed so now I no longer have to pay out of my own pocket which was great at this point in my life again I said I already borrowed money for the trip to Pittsburgh This part would be all reimbursed right regardless of whether you got a job offer or not in the end it's reimbursed by John Deere but funny hiccup in the story I didn't have a super super reliable car that day but I end up getting to the Hertz rental place in Des Moines and they didn't have a car for me and I kind of was on a tight schedule And I don't know if anybody if you've seen that pilot episode of Seinfeld where he did tell him they have the reservation they just didn't save a car and Seinfeld tells him like you know that's the whole point of the reservation you know if anybody can just take reservations if you if you take a reservation and don't save a car what's the point of the reservation So anyways you know and he gets goes back and forth with the person working there and he tells him you know if you have a reservation you got to save a car and they're like yeah Sir II know what a reservation is I know how I know how a reservation works in Seinfeld is like I don't think you do because if you did there 'd be a car here for me and anyways I was like living that again I actually told the person at the Hearst rental place I was like have you ever seen the pilot episode of Seinfeld and because that's exactly what happened they told me no we have your reservation from a week ago Nobody saved a car though for that's the only problem it was like I'm living the Seinfeld pilot episode right anyways I said screw it I didn't want to risk they said you can wait till tomorrow morning 'cause I was supposed to drive to Moline sleep the night at a hotel interview in the morning they're like well we can see if we can get one in the morning I was like no way I'm not taking a chance on that So I just took my unreliable crappy car and took my chances figured I'd just get reimbursed for the mileage Drove to Moline stayed in the hotel again this whole time I'm in the hotel i'm reviewing my interview examples again reviewing my binder reviewing how I'm going to talk about the examples when I'm going to ask the person to refer to the binder what page what tab etcetera Same thing the next morning they may take us a van a bus comes and picks us up or a van takes us to headquarters from the hotel as a group there's a bunch of people interviewing that day so we get to John Deere headquarters the next morning . 

Now first thing in the morning we did was interview and after the interview would be lunch and some tour of the John Deere headquarters so one of the things I remember very vividly was walking into the room where kind of the the conference room where all the candidates who would be interviewing today or seated together and then from there everybody would go into these breakout smaller rooms to do their interviews with the interview panels they were assigned to And I remember walking into that room and I feel like there was there were at least like 15 people there that day and I was kind of one of the last people to walk into the room and when I pulled out that binder and I started opening up and looking through it and noticed people around me saw kind of what I had and I just remember hearing kind of whisperings of people around me saying stuff like man that's a really good idea or God I wish I would have thought of that or God I should have done that nobody else I didn't see anybody else that had a binder or visual aid with them So I already at that point my confidence was kind of through the roof I felt like yeah this is this is going to set me apart if I if I interview as well as I did in Pittsburgh and I don't humble any examples and I get you know I don't get any kind of like tripped up on a question and I use the binder well I feel like I really should be able to come out on top of this group of people here who are all getting ready to interview with me at headquarters. 

So I got called into my first interview there'd be two interviews that morning with separate people each interview was just with one person sitting across the table from you and the 1st interview I got into had me worried a little bit because the person that pulled me into the interview usually in an interview like this that's an hour long scheduled usually there's some banter in the beginning and I would say like maximum 10 minutes for tell me about yourself tell me about your background let's look at your resume you know the person doing the interviewing will ask you about your history your background as the candidate they'll probably share a little bit about their background with the company that they're at interviewing you for but this person took like 20 we didn't get started on the interview questions until 30 minutes in and I was getting super super concerned but I still had to be polite I didn't want to cut him off but he went into excruciating detail about his background his experience what positions he's held what roles he's had and I remember looking at my watch and it was like 30 minutes have gone by we have not done one interview question and I know it has to end on time so now you know I'm supposed to have 50 minutes for the questions now I'm down to 30 and I'm getting concerned right but we jump into the questions I start answering his feedback seems pretty good I get good feedback positive response just like I did from the Pittsburgh interview and now the binder I feel like it's really working pretty well he's really appreciating how some of my examples the illustration and the ability to kind of see what I'm talking about as I'm talking about the examples really seem to impress him and seem to sit well and help him to understand kind of what my examples were about in that interview concluded feedback was pretty positive similar to what I got in Pittsburgh . 

The second interview of the day went even better than the first so we ended up just spending 510 minutes on banter introductions and we jumped in so I had a lot more time about 50 minutes for the interview for the behavioral based questions in the interview and this interviewer was even more impressed with the binder I think they were even more far removed I think they're not even really in engineering at all so the binder really helped to illuminate what my examples were about they were kept commenting on the binder and how easy it made it for them to understand the examples so I got even better feedback in the 2nd interview from the binder overall the interview went really really really well I felt like it was very positive and the person who interviewed me seemed very impressed and really happy with my answers and didn't really seem like there was a whole lot more I could add in terms of improvement on that interview performance when it was over. 

So after interviews we're done I think the sequence is we ended up having lunch as a as a group at headquarters then we did a tour of headquarters it's a couple of buildings talked a lot about the designer the architect the history took us back to the hotel and ended up driving back to Ames and waited to hear back about the offer if I was going to get one 

I believe similarly similarly to the first wait it was about a week and a half two weeks I remember being at work and seeing you know a phone call from a foreign number or not a foreigner but a but a non saved number on my phone that the location was Waterloo Iowa and I knew that you know John Deere's main engineering center was in Waterloo Iowa and I knew that I was interviewing for a position in Waterloo so I left my desk went to a conference room answered the phone sure enough it was somebody from the you know the engineering rotational program that I got that I got eventually got hired into it dear on the phone And it was funny because they kind of opened the conversation with some some more kind of questions that to me sounded like interview questions they were kind of like technical phone screen type of questions and I just like I've been so practiced for interviews at that point in time like I just kind of like naturally you know sometimes like when whatever like Spider-man gets like shot from the back he just turns like you know grabs the bullet or dodges it like instinct right I just like instinctually launched into like my interview examples and I was like OK this one time on a project the situation and the task and then the person on the phone kind of got taken back a little bit they're like oh they're like let me just interrupt you there They said I just want to interrupt you and really just want to clarify here like I'm not really calling you to interview you again i'm really calling you just to offer you a job with John Deere And at that point I was like relieved because at first I'm like this guy's doing a whole nother interview on the phone I wasn't prepared for but at the same time I'm like Oh my God like he just told me he's calling me to offer me a job like that's it I got the job you know and so just like overcome with of course like happiness and excitement and I'm trying you know not to get too ecstatic on the phone and pay attention make sure I'm not missing anything he's saying trying to understand what the offer is So I asked kind of if I can if I'm able to negotiate he told me the offer what the salary offer is I asked if I can negotiate Andy told me that there's no there's no negotiation really it's just take it or leave it if if I decide not to take it it'll just go to the next person in line you know some basic procedural questions about relocation package benefits things like that whatever right so told me that he'd be emailing me the official offer letter in in the in the benefits package in the offer package and everything in a few minutes or hours So I ended up reviewing that package understanding all the contents inside of it you know looking at the offer understanding if it's competitive even though there was no negotiation really for entry level position but the fact that I had you know the combination of my work experience plus the fact that was had so many extra years of education from a master's degree I was at the higher end of the range of the formula that they used to offer the starting salary so it was pretty competitive for me for industry and it was especially I mean much better than what I was making up the dot from a government job so I accepted the offer and I think somewhere around a month later or so I ended up you know I put in my two weeks at my job at the dot and I ended up moving to Waterloo Iowa relocating I spent 5 years and then I got another I got some promotions along the way there and got promoted to a manager for a position down in the Moline area moved to the Quad Cities and I've I've been out here in the Quad Cities area for almost three years now 

So some of the key things really to highlight there I think are number one you know always looking for other opportunities out there that are better than where you're at currently even if you're pretty comfortable with where you're at it doesn't hurt to put feelers out there understand what's out there Number two you know getting your resume to a state where it's actually going to impress anybody who's looking at it and at the very least you're going to list stuff on there that makes somebody who reads it think to themselves gosh I'd really like to learn more about this this is pretty interesting stuff right to have your your accomplishment listed there with the metric that you're measuring it how you accomplished it what the impact was right somebody would read that skim over 23 bullets and think to themselves man I really this guy this person seems impressive or I'd really like to meet with this person and learn more about them right that can at least convey a lot of your impact you've had over your your career or over the experiences you have on your resume to that hiring manager or recruiter etcetera The 3rd key was really digging deep getting all the details from my interview examples doing research on what competencies I should be trying to cover making sure I have what I consider 5 star interview examples to cover all the competencies that could really possibly be asked within reason in the behavioral based interview once I knew that it was going to be behavioral based the 4th key really was memorizing those examples like the back of my hand like my birth date having them just committed to memory over a week of intensive memorization and practice The 5th key was the mock interview practice really practicing delivery with another person not alone or in silence you know over my notes And the 6th piece I think was just confidence you know telling yourself that you will accomplish this no matter what there is no backup plan you know if you want to take the island burn the boats Tony Robbins style 7th piece was 7th key the binder you know setting yourself above and beyond everybody else you've you've already gone above and beyond preparation but setting yourself above and beyond in terms of a visual aid something that just really puts you over you know into the top 1% of people who've prepared and taken it seriously So those are some of the keys I think that helped me get hired at John Deere and part of the reason why I'm I started this engineering coaching business launch to lead is to help others realize their full potential to land their dream jobs their engineering jobs after school or early on in their career there's a lot of different things I've learned along the way over the past eight years I've coached a ton of people i've helped a lot of people in my network i've helped a lot of colleagues people at John Deere outside of John Deere to get really good jobs within John Deere and outside John Deere job offers at other companies including Spacex Google a lot of other different you know top companies and so II want to make that accessible to others and share some of the gems and Nuggets and you know great practices and tools methods processes that I've used and helped others use and share that with a wider audience to help others find success who might not you know have the same experience or have access to people in their network who can who can help them and coach them in some of these areas 

And I think lastly an important thing to mention really is you know since getting hired at Deer II have to give a lot of credit to my success to so many of the people that have mentored me i've had many people that I've met along the way friends you know people who I would consider you know counterparts equals people higher up than me further along in their career much further along than me help me take the time teach me mentor me teach me and like how to be successful what I can work on how to improve how to be a better leader how to be a better communicator how to set more realistic goals and accomplish them Had just a tons of good people I've met along the way who've donated so much of their time and been so generous with their time and their experience and knowledge to help me in many many many different ways I think it's you know anybody who says they got somewhere by themselves is either you know **** you or **** themselves because I think we all at some point were standing on the shoulders of giants who've helped us get where we get I've tried to do the same myself as I've gotten more experience and I've have more value to give to try to pay that forward so I think it's important to mention that into you know value that pay homage in a way I guess to the next generation or to you know the next people in line who can stand to benefit from all the knowledge that I've gained from my own experience as well as from the others who've been so incredibly generous with their time and their experience and their effort towards my career
