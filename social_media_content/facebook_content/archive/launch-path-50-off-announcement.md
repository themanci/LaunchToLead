## LINKEDIN POST

The engineering job market is brutal right now. Sound familiar?

❌ "I've sent 200+ applications and barely heard back from anyone"
❌ "I get interviews but freeze up when they ask behavioral questions"
❌ "I don't know how to talk about my experience without sounding generic"

I've been coaching engineers through this for years. Here's what's possible:

✅ **Karen B.** — Felt stuck, struggled to demonstrate her value and skills from her experiences → **4 OFFERS in under 90 days** (Google, SpaceX, GE, Bridgestone)

✅ **Sarah K.** — Intern who needed help extracting meaningful interview examples → **High paying Process Engineer role at Ford!**

**Here's the offer:**

I'm opening up a few spots for my **21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint** at **50% off**.

**$2,000 → $1,000** for 3 live 1-on-1 sessions (90 min each)

**THE 21-DAY BLUEPRINT:**

**Week 1: Resume Rebuild** — We tear apart your resume using The Impact Bullet Builder™

**Week 2: Interview Weaponization** — You'll have 15+ STAR examples ready for ANY question

**Week 3: Live Roast & Offer Machine** — Full mock interview + detailed feedback

**Who this is for:**
- Engineers stuck in the "apply and pray" cycle
- People who freeze up in behavioral interviews
- Anyone who can't articulate their value without sounding generic
