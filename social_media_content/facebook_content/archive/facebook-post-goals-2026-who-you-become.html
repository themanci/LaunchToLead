Start setting goals based on who you'll BECOME.

Here's what I mean:

In 2017, I borrowed money from a friend to fly to a job interview.

I had a wife. Two kids. A government job that barely covered the bills. And I was about to go into debt for a chance.

I could have set goals like:
🔹 "Get a better job"
🔹 "Make more money"
🔹 "Work at John Deere"

Those are fine goals. But that's not what got me hired.

What got me hired was asking:

"Who do I need to BECOME to get this job?"

The answer was uncomfortable:

✅ Someone who memorizes 15 interview examples like their birth date
✅ Someone who does 2 mock interviews a day for a week straight
✅ Someone who stands up during phone screens to project energy
✅ Someone who builds an interview binder that nobody else brings
✅ Someone who burns the boats and commits with no backup plan

That person didn't exist yet. I had to become him.

When I walked into that interview in Pittsburgh—broke, nervous, in debt to a friend—I wasn't hoping to get hired.

I was PREPARED to get hired.

8 years later, I'm still at John Deere. Multiple promotions. A career I'm proud of.

But none of it came from "wanting" something.
It came from BECOMING someone.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

So here's my challenge for you in 2026:

Don't just ask "What do I want?"

Ask:
👉 Who do I need to become to achieve it?
👉 What habits does that person have?
👉 What skills does that person possess?
👉 What sacrifices is that person willing to make?

Then start becoming that person TODAY.

Not when you feel ready.
Not when conditions are perfect.
Not when you have more time.

Today.

Because the goal isn't the point.
The person you become chasing it is.

Happy New Year! 🚀
