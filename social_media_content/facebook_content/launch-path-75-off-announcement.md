## LINKEDIN POST

I'm opening up 5 spots for something I've never offered before.

For the past few years, I've been coaching engineers — helping them land their first jobs, nail interviews, and escape the "application black hole."

Here's what's happened:

✅ **Gavin P.** — New grad with zero industry experience → $75K+ Fortune 500 software role
✅ **Sarah K.** — Intern → $106K total comp at Ford Motor Company
✅ **Karen B.** — Stuck and intimidated by interviews → SpaceX, Google & Bridgestone interviews
✅ **Mohamed I.** — Trapped in contract work → Permanent role + software pivot

Now I want to work with more people in my network.

**Here's the offer:**

I'm offering my **Launch Path coaching** at 75% off for a limited time.

That's **3 one-on-one 90-minute sessions for $500** (normally $2,000).

Here's what we cover:
- Resume that actually gets responses
- LinkedIn optimization that attracts recruiters
- Interview prep that builds real confidence
- Behavioral stories that land offers
- Personalized strategy for YOUR situation

**Who this is for:**
- Engineers (or soon-to-be engineers) looking for their first role or next role
- People stuck in the "apply and pray" cycle
- Anyone who's tired of sending 100+ applications into the void

**Who this is NOT for:**
- People who aren't willing to put in the work
- Anyone looking for a quick fix or magic bullet

If this sounds like you (or someone you know), DM me or comment below.

I only have 5 spots at this price. First come, first served.
