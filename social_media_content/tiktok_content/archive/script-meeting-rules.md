## SCRIPT & SHOT LIST

### SHOT 1 — Face to Camera (4 sec)
**[HOOK — frustrated energy, like you're venting to a friend]**

"Okay, can we talk about meetings for a second? Because I used to sit through SO many that went absolutely nowhere."

---

### SHOT 2 — Face to Camera (5 sec)
**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Hour-long 'discussions' with no outcome"]**

"You know the ones. Hour-long 'discussions.' Half the room on laptops. No clear outcome. And then—my favorite part—"

---

### SHOT 3 — Face to Camera (4 sec)
**[Hand gesture, sarcastic]**
**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Let's schedule a follow-up"]**

"We schedule ANOTHER meeting to follow up on the first meeting."

---

### SHOT 4 — Face to Camera (3 sec)
**[Shift tone — calmer, more helpful]**

"So here's what actually helped me. Four things. Nothing revolutionary, just stuff that works."

---

### SHOT 5 — Face to Camera (12 sec)
**[TEXT OVERLAY: "#1 — Send a clear agenda 24h ahead"]**
**[Count on fingers as you go]**

"One: Send a clear agenda 24 hours ahead. Not 'let's discuss the project.' I mean: what's the goal, what decision are we making, and what info do we need to make it. People can actually prepare that way."

---

### SHOT 6 — Face to Camera (10 sec)
**[TEXT OVERLAY: "#2 — Actually facilitate"]**

"Two: Actually facilitate. Don't just sit there hoping the conversation goes somewhere. Call on people. 'Hey Sarah, what's your take on the timeline?' That way nobody hides in the corner checking email while decisions get made without them."

---

### SHOT 7 — Face to Camera (10 sec)
**[TEXT OVERLAY: "#3 — Put away the laptops"]**

"Three: Put away the laptops. This one's hard, but context-switching kills your focus. Like, research says you lose 40% of your brainpower. If you're too distracted to be present, honestly—just decline the meeting."

---

### SHOT 8 — Face to Camera (10 sec)
**[TEXT OVERLAY: "#4 — End with actions"]**

"Four: Always end with actions. Last few minutes: 'Who's doing what by when?' Then follow up in writing. That one change alone cut my follow-up meetings in half."

---

### SHOT 9 — Face to Camera (8 sec)
**[Lean in slightly, more conversational]**

"None of this is rocket science. But actually doing it consistently? That made a real difference for me. Fewer meetings. Less confusion. Less of my time wasted."

---

### SHOT 10 — Face to Camera (5 sec)
**[CTA — direct but casual]**

"Try one of these in your next meeting. Let me know which one works for you."

---

## TOTAL TIME: ~70–80 seconds

## FILMING TIPS
- Film all shots in one sitting (just talk through it naturally)
- Pause briefly between sections for easy editing
- Use CapCut or TikTok editor to add text overlays
- Cut dead space to keep pacing tight
- Add captions (TikTok auto-captions work)
- Background music: trending lo-fi or soft beat, LOW volume
