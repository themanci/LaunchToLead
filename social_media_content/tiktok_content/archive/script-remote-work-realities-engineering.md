## HOOK (0:00 - 0:05)

"Dreaming of a remote engineering job? Here's what nobody tells you."

---

## THE SETUP (0:05 - 0:15)

"Remote engineering jobs are definitely out there. I know people who work fully remote doing consulting, design work, all of it from their home office.

Sounds like the dream, right?

But there's a hidden downside."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:40)

"When you're in the office, you get something I call osmosis learning.

You overhear how a senior engineer solves a problem. You get pulled into a random whiteboard session. You have a hallway conversation that turns into a career opportunity.

That stuff doesn't happen on Zoom.

And here's the uncomfortable part — remote workers often get stuck with the busywork.

Why? Because managers assign the independent, low-interaction tasks to remote people. The complex, collaborative, career-advancing projects? Those go to the people in the room.

Not always. But often enough to matter."

---

## THE NUANCE (0:40 - 1:00)

"Now, does that mean remote is bad? No.

Remote is great if:
- You live somewhere with no local engineering jobs
- You need flexibility for certifications or family
- You're building something on the side
- You just don't want to deal with micromanagement

For some people, that flexibility is worth more than faster career growth. And that's a valid trade-off.

Just make it intentionally."

---

## THE FIX (1:00 - 1:20)

"If you go remote, here's how to not get stuck:

One — schedule regular check-ins. Don't wait for your manager.

Two — volunteer for cross-functional projects. Get visibility.

Three — speak up in meetings. Don't be the quiet box on the screen.

Four — build relationships on purpose. The hallway conversations won't happen by accident."

---

## THE CLOSE (1:20 - 1:30)

"Bottom line: remote can work. But know what you're optimizing for.

If it's max career growth — especially early on — in-office or hybrid might give you an edge.

If it's flexibility — remote is fine. Just stay visible.

Follow for more."
