**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

"If career fairs make you sweat bullets and networking feels painful—here's how I went from hiding in bathrooms to actually enjoying it."

**[THE TRUTH - 0:05-0:15]**

"First, accept this: You're not going to magically become an extrovert. That's not the goal.

The goal is to train that little extrovert inside you to come out when you need it."

**[TIP 1 - 0:15-0:25]**

"Tip one: Practice makes progress.

Every awkward conversation is training. Every uncomfortable networking event is a rep at the gym.

The only way to get better at talking to people you find intimidating? Do it anyway. Repeatedly."

**[TIP 2 - 0:25-0:40]**

"Tip two: Set specific goals.

'I want to network more' is not a goal. It's a wish.

Real goals sound like:
- 'Five new LinkedIn connections every week'
- 'Professor office hours once a week'
- 'Join Toastmasters and practice public speaking'

Specific targets force you out of your comfort zone. Vague intentions don't."

**[TIP 3 - 0:40-0:50]**

"Tip three: Start with your passions.

It's way easier to be social about things you actually care about. Join clubs that matter to you. Meet people in contexts you enjoy.

Passion makes conversation flow naturally."

**[REALITY CHECK - 0:50-1:00]**

"Here's the thing: if you're in an interview and you're so shy it's hard to communicate with you—how high do you think they'll rank you on 'works well with others'?"

**[CTA - 1:00-1:10]**

"Networking isn't optional. But it IS learnable.

What's one networking goal you're committing to this week? Drop it in the comments."
