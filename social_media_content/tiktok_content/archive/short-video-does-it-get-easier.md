**[HOOK - 0:00-0:03]**

"Working full-time while going to school? Here's the truth nobody tells you."

**[CONTEXT - 0:03-0:08]**

"A student asked me: does it get EASIER after I graduate and start my career?"

**[ANSWER - 0:08-0:12]**

"My honest answer? Yes. And here's why."

**[POINT 1 - 0:12-0:20]**

"One—the uncertainty disappears. Right now you're grinding wondering 'is this gonna pay off?' Once you land that job—that question is ANSWERED. You made it."

**[POINT 2 - 0:20-0:32]**

"Two—no more juggling three lives. School, work, personal life—constantly switching. After graduation? ONE focus. Your evenings are yours. Your weekends are yours. And those stress PEAKS? Exams, finals, projects while working? Gone. Work stress is way more flat."

**[POINT 3 - 0:32-0:42]**

"Three—future stress is voluntary. In school you're working for a POTENTIAL reward. In your career? It's CERTAIN. You take that promotion knowing exactly what you're getting."

**[CLOSER - 0:42-0:50]**

"So if you're in the grind right now—remember this: this too shall pass. It's only a few years. The finish line is closer than you think."

**[CTA - 0:50-0:55]**

"Keep going. Follow for more."
