## FULL SCRIPT (60-90 sec):

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:04]**

"How do you sell yourself in an interview without sounding arrogant? A client just asked me this."

**[CONFIDENCE - 0:04-0:25]**

"Here's the thing—confidence comes from actually knowing your stuff.

Know your projects deeply. Know the details.

And stop saying 'we delivered this.' Start saying 'I did this.' Own YOUR contribution.

Practice telling your stories out loud until it feels natural. That's where real confidence comes from—not faking it."

**[HUMILITY - 0:25-0:50]**

"But here's how you stay humble so you don't tip into arrogant:

Give credit to your teammates. 'I led this while my teammate handled that.'

Ask intelligent questions. Arrogant people don't ask questions—they act like they know everything.

And share your failures. Talk about what you learned, what you'd do differently. Arrogant people never admit mistakes."

**[KEY INSIGHT - 0:50-1:05]**

"The difference is simple:

Arrogant people think they have nothing to learn.

Confident people know their worth AND their limits.

They own their wins. They share their lessons. They give credit where it's due."

**[CTA - 1:05-1:15]**

"The balance isn't a trick—it's just being real.

Follow for more interview tips."
