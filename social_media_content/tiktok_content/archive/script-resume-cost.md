# TikTok Script: The Real Cost of a Bad Resume

**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Style:** Direct to camera, conversational, slight urgency  
**CTA:** Free guide link in bio

## HOOK (0-5 seconds)

**[Look directly at camera, slightly concerned expression]**

"Let me show you how much money you're actually losing every month you spend job hunting."

---

## THE MATH (5-30 seconds)

**[Lean in slightly, counting on fingers or use text overlays]**

"The average entry-level engineering salary is around 80K a year. That's roughly $6,700 a month.

Every single month you spend applying to jobs with a resume that isn't working?

That's $6,700 you're not earning.

Three months? Twenty thousand dollars.
Six months? Forty thousand.

That's not just lost income—that's retirement contributions, student loan payments, rent you're stressing about."

---

## THE REAL PROBLEM (30-60 seconds)

**[Shift tone to empathetic, slow down]**

"And here's the thing—I've worked with dozens of engineers who spent months applying to hundreds of jobs. Hundreds.

The problem was never their experience. Never their skills. Never their degree.

It was how they were presenting it.

Most engineering resumes read like job descriptions. Tasks listed. Responsibilities copied. Nothing that makes you stand out.

Hiring managers spend about six seconds on your resume before deciding. Six seconds. If yours looks like everyone else's? You get filtered out."

---

## THE FIX (60-90 seconds)

**[Energy picks up, lean forward]**

"The fix isn't complicated. It's about showing impact, not just activity.

Instead of 'Developed software for manufacturing systems'—

**[Use hand gesture or text overlay]**

Try: 'Built automated testing system that reduced defect rate by 34%, saving $120K annually.'

Same job. Same experience. Completely different outcome.

One engineer I worked with went from zero callbacks—zero—to four offers in 90 days after making this shift.

Another went from anxious intern to a $106K offer at Ford."

---

## CTA (90-110 seconds)

**[Direct, helpful tone]**

"If your resume isn't getting callbacks, it's probably not a you problem. It's a presentation problem. And that's fixable.

I made a free guide called the Impact Bullet Builder that shows you exactly how to rewrite your bullets so they actually stand out.

Link's in my bio. Go grab it."

**[Slight pause, then casual]**

"Stop bleeding money. Fix your resume."
