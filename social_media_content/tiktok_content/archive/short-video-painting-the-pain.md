## SCRIPT

---

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:08]**

"Your interview stories aren't landing, and I'm gonna tell you exactly why."

*[Direct eye contact, confident energy]*

---

**[PROBLEM - 0:08-0:20]**

"Most people rush through the SITUATION part of their STAR stories. They treat it like a boring intro they need to get through.

Then they're confused why their 'amazing results' don't impress anyone."

---

**[THE INSIGHT - 0:20-0:35]**

"Here's what you need to understand:

The bigger the monster you slay... the bigger the hero you become.

Your results are only as impressive as the problem they solved. So you need to make that problem sound HARD."

---

**[BAD EXAMPLE - 0:35-0:50]**

"Here's what most people say:

'We had a project running behind schedule, so I helped get it back on track.'

Cool. But... so what? There's no stakes. No tension. No reason for me to care."

*[Shrug, underwhelmed expression]*

---

**[GOOD EXAMPLE - 0:50-1:15]**

"Now watch what happens when you PAINT THE PAIN:

'Our flagship product launch was six weeks behind. The CEO was personally reviewing our progress every single day. Every week of delay was costing us two hundred thousand dollars. Two team leads had already quit from the pressure.'

SAME story. Completely different weight."

*[Lean in, emphasize key numbers with hands]*

---

**[QUICK FRAMEWORK - 1:15-1:35]**

"Three things to include:

ONE - Quantify the stakes. Revenue, users, timeline pressure.

TWO - Show the tension. Who was watching? What happens if you fail?

THREE - Create contrast. The bigger you make the problem, the more impressive YOUR solution becomes."

*[Count on fingers]*

---

**[THE MATH - 1:35-1:50]**

"Most people spend ten percent of their story on the situation.

Top performers? Forty percent.

They let the interviewer FEEL the weight of the problem before they reveal how they solved it."

---

**[CTA - 1:50-2:00]**

"So next interview, before you explain what you DID...

Make them understand why it MATTERED.

Slay bigger monsters. Become a bigger hero."

*[Point at camera on last line]*
