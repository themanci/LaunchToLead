# Your Best Example Might Not Look "Technical"

**Platform:** TikTok / Instagram Reels / YouTube Shorts

---

## Script

**Hook:**
- "Your best interview story might come from a retail job."

**Setup:**
- "I was coaching someone yesterday, doing mock interview practice."
- "I asked: 'Tell me about a time you adapted your communication style for a different audience.'"
- "They said—'I have an example... but I don't think it counts. It's not really technical.'"
- "I said, 'What's the example?'"

**The Reveal:**
- "They trained a coworker on the autism spectrum at a previous job to do a specific task."
- "I stopped them. 'That's one of the BEST examples I've heard.'"

**The Insight:**
- "Here's what most people don't get."
- "Everyone else says 'I presented to marketing' or 'I explained code to my manager.'"
- "But THIS example shows REAL empathy. Real patience. Adapting without being condescending. Actually caring about how someone ELSE learns."
- "That's so much more powerful."

**Takeaway:**
- "Communication isn't about 'explaining things simply.'"
- "It's about connecting with ANYONE—regardless of how they process information."
- "Stop dismissing your unconventional examples. They might be the ones that set you apart."

**CTA:**
- "What example have you been hesitant to use? Drop it in the comments."
