## HOOK (0:00 - 0:05)

"If you have a low GPA and you're worried it's gonna ruin your job search — watch this."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:05 - 0:15)

"A lot of engineering students think a sub-3.0 GPA is a death sentence.

They either leave it off their resume completely — which makes recruiters assume it's even worse — or they panic when it comes up in interviews."

---

## THE FRAMEWORK (0:15 - 0:50)

"Here's exactly what to do. Use the A-B-C framework.

**A — Acknowledge it.**

Don't hide. Don't make excuses. Just state it.

'My GPA is 2.6. I struggled early on due to some personal circumstances.'

**B — Bridge to improvement.**

'But I've made significant improvements since then.'

**C — Show your capability.**

'I raised my major GPA, got A's in my hardest engineering courses, and gained real hands-on experience through internships.'

That's it. Acknowledge, bridge, capability."

---

## THE REFRAME (0:50 - 1:10)

"Here's what most people don't realize:

Recruiters aren't just looking at the number. They're trying to answer one question — can this person do the job?

If you went from a 1.7 to a 2.6? That's a story of grit.

If you got A's in thermodynamics and process controls? That's proof you can handle hard stuff.

Give them evidence. That's what matters."

---

## THE GOOD NEWS (1:10 - 1:25)

"And here's the best part:

After your first job — even if it's entry level — nobody cares about your GPA ever again.

One year of work experience wipes out four years of grades.

Your only goal right now is to get that first opportunity."

---

## THE CLOSE (1:25 - 1:35)

"So stop hiding from your GPA.

Own it. Explain it. Show your growth.

It's a chapter in your story — not the whole book.

Follow for more."
