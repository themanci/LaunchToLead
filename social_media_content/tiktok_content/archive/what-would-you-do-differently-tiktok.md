## SCRIPT

**[HOOK - First 1-2 seconds]**
"Stop answering interview questions. Start answering the NEXT one."

---

**[PATTERN INTERRUPT - Seconds 2-5]**
"Here's what I mean."

"Every time you finish answering a behavioral question in an interview, there's a follow-up coming."

---

**[THE PROBLEM - Seconds 5-12]**
"'What would you do differently if you could do it again?'"

"And the amount of people I've seen get caught off guard by this question is embarrassing."

"They stumble. They freeze. They make something up."

---

**[THE REFRAME - Seconds 12-20]**
"Here's the move:"

"Don't wait for them to ask it."

"You answer it BEFORE they even think of it."

"At the end of your story, you say: 'Looking back, if I were to do this again, here's what I would change...'"

---

**[THE VALUE STACK - Seconds 20-35]**
"This does three things:"

"One — it shows you're reflective. You don't just do stuff. You think about what went well and what didn't."

"Two — it shows you actually improve. You're not just hoping to get better. You have a plan."

"Three — it shows humility. You're not delusional. You know you're not perfect. And that's exactly the kind of person teams want to work with."

---

**[THE TAKEAWAY - Seconds 35-45]**
"For every example you're prepping—know the answer to this question before you walk in the door."

"Better yet? Don't wait for them to ask."

"Tell them first."

"That's the difference between someone who did a thing... and someone who learned from it."

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES (Test These)

**Option A (Curiosity Gap):**
"There's a question that comes after almost every interview answer. And most people aren't ready for it."

**Option B (Bold Claim):**
"The best interview answer isn't the one they ask for. It's the one they were ABOUT to ask for."

**Option C (Pattern Interrupt):**
"You just gave a great answer in your interview. Congrats. Now here's where most people blow it."

**Option D (Direct Command):**
"If you're prepping for interviews, write this down."

- **Gestures:** Use hands for the "three things" section (count on fingers).
