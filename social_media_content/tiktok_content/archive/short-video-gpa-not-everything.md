**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

"Is your GPA the first thing recruiters look at when reviewing your resume? Hint: It's not."

**[THE TRUTH - 0:05-0:18]**

"Here's what most students don't realize: your GPA is just a hurdle—not a ranking system.

Most companies have a minimum cutoff, usually somewhere between 2.8 and 3.0. Once you clear that bar? They basically stop caring."

**[THE SHIFT - 0:18-0:32]**

"What actually gets you hired is your story.

Not your transcript. Your story.

I'm talking about:
- What do you actually want to do and WHY?
- What hands-on projects have you worked on?
- What problems have you solved?
- What makes YOU different from every other applicant with similar grades?"

**[THE PROOF - 0:32-0:42]**

"I've seen 3.9 GPAs get passed over because they couldn't articulate their goals. And I've seen 2.9 GPAs land dream jobs because they had a clear vision and the experience to back it up.

The difference? One had grades. The other had a story."

**[CTA - 0:42-0:55]**

"So if you're stressing about not having a perfect GPA—stop.

Start building your story instead. Get hands-on experience. Figure out what you actually want.

That's what gets you hired."
