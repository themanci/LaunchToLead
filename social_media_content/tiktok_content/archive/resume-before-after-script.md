## SCRIPT & SHOT LIST

### SHOT 1 — Face to Camera (3 sec)
**[HOOK — look directly at camera, energy up]**

"This is what most engineers' resumes look like when they come to me."

---

### SHOT 2 — GRAPHIC: slide-01-before.html (5 sec)
**[Show full screen. Let them read. You keep talking over it.]**

"Generic. Task-based. Reads like a job description copy-paste."

---

### SHOT 3 — Face to Camera (3 sec)
**[Shake head, lean in]**

"This is what it looked like after our FIRST session together. Session one of three."

---

### SHOT 4 — GRAPHIC: slide-02-after.html (8 sec)
**[Show full screen. Let the impact sink in. Talk over it.]**

"Metrics. Scale. Impact. The same experience — told completely differently."

---

### SHOT 5 — Face to Camera (4 sec)
**[Point at camera or count on fingers]**

"We didn't change what they did. We changed HOW they said it. Same job. Same person."

---

### SHOT 6 — GRAPHIC: slide-03-difference.html (5 sec)
**[Show the side-by-side comparison. Keep talking.]**

"Before: 'I did stuff.' After: 'Here's the measurable impact I created.' One gets filtered out. The other gets you a phone call."

---

### SHOT 7 — Face to Camera (5 sec)
**[CTA — direct, confident]**

"If your resume reads like a job description, you're invisible. DM me 'resume' and I'll tell you exactly what's wrong with yours. For free."

## FILMING TIPS
- Film face shots first, all in a row (Shots 1, 3, 5, 7)
- Edit in the graphics between clips using CapCut or TikTok editor
- Add the graphics as "overlay" images at full screen
- Use a pop/whoosh sound effect on each transition to graphic
- Add captions (TikTok auto-captions work fine)
- Background music: trending lo-fi or motivational beat, LOW volume
