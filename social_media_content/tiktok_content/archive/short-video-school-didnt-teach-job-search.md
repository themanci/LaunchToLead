**[HOOK - 0:00-0:06]**

"A coaching client told me something that hit hard. She said: 'It's like engineering school taught us how to be engineers, but not how to get a good job.'"

**[THE GAP - 0:06-0:25]**

"Think about it. Four years of thermodynamics, data structures, differential equations, brutal exams...

But zero courses on:
- How to write a resume that gets callbacks
- How to network without being awkward  
- How to answer 'tell me about yourself'
- How to negotiate your salary

Nothing."

**[THE ANALOGY - 0:25-0:35]**

"It's like learning how to BUILD a race car... but never learning how to DRIVE it.

The skills that make you good at the job are completely different from the skills that get you the job."

**[THE REALITY - 0:35-0:50]**

"Then graduation comes and suddenly you're expected to have a personal brand, navigate applicant tracking systems, tell compelling stories in interviews...

With zero training. And most engineers figure this out the hard way—after months of rejections."

**[THE TRUTH - 0:50-1:05]**

"But here's the thing: the job search is a skill. And like any skill, it can be learned.

If you're feeling this gap right now—you're not alone. It's not your fault. The system just never taught you this part."

**[CTA - 1:05-1:15]**

"The same brain that got you through engineering school can figure this out too. Follow for more."

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

"Engineering school taught you how to be an engineer—but not how to get a job."

**[BODY - 0:05-0:35]**

"Four years of technical classes. Zero courses on resumes, networking, interviewing, or salary negotiation.

It's like learning to build a race car but never learning to drive it.

Then graduation hits and you're expected to figure it all out—with no training. Most people learn the hard way after months of rejections."

**[CTA - 0:35-0:45]**

"But the job search is a learnable skill. You're not alone in this. Follow for more."
