## SCRIPT

---

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

"Want to instantly sound more organized in interviews? Do this."

---

**[THE TECHNIQUE - 0:05-0:15]**

"Start your answer with a number.

'I took three key actions to resolve this issue...'

That's it. One sentence changes everything."

---

**[WHY IT WORKS - 0:15-0:35]**

"Here's why. When you say 'three actions,' the interviewer knows exactly what's coming. They can follow along. They can take clean notes.

And YOU can't ramble—because you committed to three."

---

**[BEFORE/AFTER - 0:35-0:50]**

"Instead of: 'So basically I started looking at the problem and talked to some people...'

Say: 'I took three actions. First this. Second this. Third this.'

Same story. One sounds scattered. One sounds like a leader."

---

**[CTA - 0:50-0:55]**

"Try it. Start with a number. Sound more organized instantly."
