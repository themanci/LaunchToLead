## Talking Points

### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
- I keep seeing engineers kill their own leverage
- They bring up deal breakers BEFORE they have an offer
- "I'm not sure I'd relocate" / "I prefer remote" / "That salary might be too low"
- You're shooting yourself in the foot

### THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:40)
- Before you have an offer, you're COMPETING
- Being compared to other candidates
- Evaluated on skills AND "ease of hire"
- When you list reasons you might say no, you plant seeds:
  - "This person has baggage"
  - "Other candidate doesn't have these concerns"
  - "Why take the risk?"

### THE KICKER (0:40-1:10)
- Here's what people don't realize
- What you think is a deal breaker NOW might not be later
- Companies make exceptions for people they really want:
  - Increase offers
  - Negotiate remote policies
  - Make relocation exceptions
  - Find creative solutions
- But only if they want YOU badly enough
- They won't get there if you've already given reasons to pass

### THE STRATEGY (1:10-1:45)
- Before the offer:
  - Be agreeable
  - Be flexible
  - Be enthusiastic
  - Keep concerns to yourself
- After the offer:
  - NOW you negotiate
  - NOW you're transparent
  - NOW you discuss trade-offs
  - NOW you have leverage

### CARDS TO KEEP CLOSE (1:45-2:15)
- Things NOT to bring up before an offer:
  - Don't want to relocate
  - Need fully remote
  - Don't like the region
  - Salary is below your minimum
  - Start date doesn't work
  - Team isn't your first choice
- All become negotiating points AFTER the offer
- Before the offer = reasons to pass on you

### CTA (2:15-2:30)
- The offer is when the power shifts
- Before: you're auditioning
- After: they're selling
- Don't give away your cards before you're at the table
- Get the offer first. Then negotiate everything.

2. The Interview Mistake That Kills Your Leverage
3. Why You Should NEVER Mention This Before Getting an Offer
4. Engineers: Stop Shooting Yourself in the Foot During Interviews

## YouTube Description

I keep seeing engineers make the same mistake during interviews.

They bring up deal breakers before they even have an offer—and it kills their leverage.

In this video:
- Why mentioning concerns early plants seeds of doubt
- What the hiring team actually thinks when you do this
- The "kicker" most people don't realize about deal breakers
- What to do before vs. after you have an offer
- Specific things you should NEVER bring up during interviews

The offer is when the power shifts. Get it first, then negotiate.
