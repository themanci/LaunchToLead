## SCRIPT

---

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:08]**

"Your GPA is lower than you want it to be. Let me tell you what actually works—and what doesn't."

*[Direct, no-BS energy]*

---

**[HONEST REALITY - 0:08-0:20]**

"First, let's be real.

Some companies have hard GPA cutoffs. 3.0 minimum means 3.0 minimum. No amount of side projects or networking is gonna change that.

But a lot of companies? They're flexible. And HERE'S what you do."

---

**[STRATEGY 1 - 0:20-0:40]**

"Number one: Tell the transition story.

College is HARD. A lot of students struggle those first couple semesters. You're living on your own, nobody's making you go to class, and suddenly you're bombing organic chemistry.

But if you improved later? SHOW THAT.

'My cumulative is 2.7, but my last two years averaged 3.4.'

That tells a completely different story."

---

**[STRATEGY 2 - 0:40-0:55]**

"Number two: Use your CORE engineering GPA.

If your major GPA is higher than your overall because gen eds dragged you down? Use it.

'Engineering GPA: 3.3' — that's one hundred percent legitimate on your resume."

---

**[STRATEGY 3 - 0:55-1:10]**

"Number three: Highlight the wins you DO have.

An A in thermodynamics? Mention it.
Killed your senior design project? Talk about it.
Dean's list one semester? That counts.

You're not lying. You're showing the full picture."

---

**[STRATEGY 4 - 1:10-1:25]**

"Number four: Get in front of HUMANS.

ATS systems filter you out automatically. But career fairs? Referrals? LinkedIn messages to actual engineers?

A human can see your growth story. A bot just sees the number."

---

**[CLOSE - 1:25-1:40]**

"And if they ask about your GPA in the interview?

Own it briefly. Show your growth. Then redirect to your wins.

Will this work every time? No. Some doors are just closed.

But it works way more often than you'd think."

*[Nod confidently]*

---

**[CTA - 1:40-1:45]**

"Follow for more job search strategies that actually work."

## VIDEO DESCRIPTION

Your GPA doesn't tell your whole story—but you need to know how to tell it.

In this video, I break down 5 strategies to mitigate a low GPA in your engineering job search:

✅ Tell your transition story (show growth, not just the number)
✅ Use your core engineering GPA if it's higher
✅ Highlight specific wins—tough classes, great projects
✅ Show independent work beyond the syllabus
✅ Get in front of humans, not just ATS bots

Some companies have hard cutoffs—nothing changes that. But many don't, and these strategies work more often than you'd think.
