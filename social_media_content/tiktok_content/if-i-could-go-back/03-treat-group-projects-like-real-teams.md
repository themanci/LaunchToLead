## HOOK (0:00–0:04)

"I was a Scrum Master. Then an Engineering Manager. The #1 skill gap in new hires? It's not technical."

---

## THE GAP (0:04–0:18)

"It's collaboration.

Real collaboration. Not 'split the work into four parts and merge it the night before.'

I mean — running a standup. Giving feedback to someone who isn't pulling their weight. Navigating disagreement when two people want to build it differently.

THAT is what the job actually is."

---

## THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY (0:18–0:35)

"And here's the thing — group projects in school are the ONLY lab you get for this.

The only time you practice working with people you didn't choose, on a timeline you can't control, toward a goal that's vaguely defined.

Sound familiar? That's literally every sprint at every company.

And I wasted every single one. I just did my part and avoided conflict."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:35–0:55)

"If I could go back:

I'd volunteer to be the project lead — even when it sucked.

I'd run weekly check-ins with my team — even for a class project.

I'd practice giving feedback: 'Hey, your section needs more detail' — professionally, not passive-aggressively over text at midnight.

I'd practice receiving it too. Because as a manager, the people I promoted fastest weren't the best coders. They were the ones who could work with ANYONE."

---

## THE PUNCHLINE (0:55–1:05)

"Every group project you hate? That's interview prep. That's career prep.

Stop surviving them. Start treating them like the job."

---

## CTA (1:05–1:15)

"Part 3 of 10. If this is hitting, follow — it goes deeper."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Relatable):**
"You know that group project where one person did nothing? That happens at work too. Here's how to handle it."

**Option B (Bold):**
"I managed engineers for two years. The ones who couldn't collaborate didn't last. And school was their only chance to practice."

**Option C (Direct):**
"Group projects aren't about the grade. They're about learning to work with people who aren't like you."

## POSTING NOTES

- The "split the work and merge at midnight" line should be delivered with knowing frustration — everyone's been there
- Speed up slightly during the "what I'd do differently" section — rapid-fire conviction
- Pin comment: "Be honest — have you ever actually LED a group project? Or just survived one?"
