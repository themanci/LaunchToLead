# If I Could Go Back #2 — I'd Learn to Write Before I Learned to Code

**Series:** 10 Things I'd Do Differently as an Engineering Student
**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length:** 60–90 seconds
**Style:** Talking head, direct to camera
**Role POV:** Staff Engineer — 8 years across engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, software development enablement leader

## HOOK (0:00–0:04)

"As a Staff Engineer, I write more than I code. And nobody warned me."

---

## THE REALITY (0:04–0:20)

"Design documents. Architecture proposals. RFC reviews. Slack messages that influence whether a team of 30 engineers builds Feature A or Feature B.

That's my Tuesday.

When I was a junior engineer, I thought the job was code. When I became a staff engineer, I realized the job is COMMUNICATION."

---

## THE CAREER MAP (0:20–0:35)

"Here's how it broke down across my career:

As an engineer — maybe 70% coding, 30% writing.
As a scrum master — 90% writing and facilitating.
As a product owner — 80% writing requirements and aligning stakeholders.
As a manager — 95% writing, emails, reviews, strategies.
As a staff engineer — 60% writing, 40% coding. Maybe.

The higher you go, the more your keyboard is for WORDS. Not code."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:35–0:55)

"If I could go back to school, I'd:

Take a technical writing class. Voluntarily.

Write documentation for my class projects — even when it wasn't required.

Practice writing emails that are three sentences instead of three paragraphs.

Because the engineer who writes a clear one-page design doc saves their team 20 hours of confusion. The one who can't? They CREATE the confusion."

---

## THE PUNCHLINE (0:55–1:05)

"Your code gets reviewed once. Your writing gets read by your entire org.

Learn to write. It's the highest-leverage skill no engineering program teaches."

---

## CTA (1:05–1:15)

"Part 2 of 10. Follow for the rest — this series only gets more real."

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Shock):**
"60% of my job as a Staff Engineer isn't code. It's writing. And I was NOT prepared."

**Option B (Question):**
"What skill do senior engineers use more than coding? Writing. And nobody teaches it."

**Option C (Stat):**
"I looked at my calendar last week. 4 design docs, 12 Slack threads, 2 strategy memos. Lines of code? Maybe 50."
