# If I Could Go Back #7 — I'd Practice Explaining Technical Things to Non-Technical People

**Series:** 10 Things I'd Do Differently as an Engineering Student
**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length:** 60–90 seconds
**Style:** Talking head, direct to camera
**Role POV:** Staff Engineer — 8 years across engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, software development enablement leader

## HOOK (0:00–0:05)

"The skill that separates a senior engineer from a staff engineer isn't technical. It's translation."

---

## THE JOB (0:05–0:18)

"As a Software Development Enablement Leader, I spent half my week translating.

Engineer says: 'We need to refactor the authentication microservice to reduce latency on the token refresh flow.'

Executive hears: noise.

My job? Turn that into: 'Login is slow. We can fix it in two sprints. It'll reduce support tickets by 30%.'

Same problem. One version gets funded. One gets ignored."

---

## WHY IT MATTERS (0:18–0:32)

"Every level of your career, the audience changes:

Junior engineer — you explain to other engineers.
Senior engineer — you explain to product managers.
Staff engineer — you explain to VPs and directors.
Principal — you explain to the C-suite.

The technical complexity stays the same. But the translation skills have to go UP every single level.

And almost nobody practices this in school."

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:32–0:52)

"If I could go back:

I'd explain my capstone project to my parents. Not the technical version. The 'why does this matter to a real person' version.

I'd practice the 30-second version of every project I worked on. No jargon. No acronyms.

I'd find a non-engineering friend and explain what I was learning — and if THEY couldn't repeat it back, I'd simplify further.

Because in the real world, the engineer who can explain the problem clearly to a room full of non-engineers? That's the one who gets the budget, the headcount, and the promotion."

---

## THE PUNCHLINE (0:52–1:05)

"Your ability to be understood is more valuable than your ability to be impressive.

If they can't follow you, they can't fund you."

---

## CTA (1:05–1:15)

"Part 7 of 10. These get more real from here — follow."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Challenge):**
"Explain your last project to me like I'm your mom. Can you do it in 30 seconds? If not — that's a problem."

**Option B (Story):**
"I watched a brilliant engineer lose funding for her project because she couldn't explain it to a VP. That's when I got it."

**Option C (Direct):**
"The most underpaid engineers are the ones who can't explain their work. Here's why."

## TEXT OVERLAY SEQUENCE

- 0:00 — "Senior → Staff? It's translation."
- 0:06 — "ENGINEER VERSION vs. EXEC VERSION"
- 0:10 — "❌ 'Refactor the auth microservice...'"
- 0:14 — "✅ 'Login is slow. 2 sprints. -30% tickets.'"
- 0:18 — "THE AUDIENCE CHANGES AT EVERY LEVEL"
- 0:22 — "Junior: Engineers → Senior: PMs → Staff: VPs"
- 0:32 — "WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY"
- 0:52 — "Understood > Impressive"

## CAPTION

"Half my job as an enablement leader was translating engineer-speak for executives. This skill alone changes your entire career trajectory. Part 7 of 10 🎓🗣️ #communication #staffengineer #enablement #engineeringstudent #careeradvice #LaunchToLead"

---

## POSTING NOTES

- Do the engineer-speak vs. exec-speak side by side — shift body language slightly (hunched/technical vs. upright/clear)
- The career level list should be rapid — almost like climbing stairs
- "If they can't follow you, they can't fund you" — deliver slow, with a pause before "fund"
- Pin comment: "Try it — explain your last project in 30 seconds, no jargon. Drop it below 👇"
