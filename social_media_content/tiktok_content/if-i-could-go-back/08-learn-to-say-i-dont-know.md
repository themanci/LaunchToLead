## HOOK (0:00–0:05)

"The three most powerful words in engineering aren't 'I fixed it.' They're 'I don't know.'"

---

## THE TRAP (0:05–0:18)

"When I was a new engineer, I was TERRIFIED of looking stupid.

Someone would ask a question in a meeting and I'd either:
A) Make up something that sounded semi-plausible, or
B) Stay silent and hope they moved on.

Both are career killers. Just in different ways.

Faking it erodes trust. Silence makes you invisible."

---

## WHAT SENIOR ENGINEERS DO (0:18–0:35)

"Here's what I learned after managing engineers and running scrum teams for years:

The people who moved fastest said this exact sentence:

'I don't know, but I'll find out by Friday.'

That's it. Nine words.

It shows honesty — you're not pretending.
It shows ownership — you're not passing the buck.
It shows follow-through — you gave a DEADLINE.

As a scrum master, the engineers I trusted most weren't the ones who knew everything. They were the ones who were honest about what they DIDN'T know — and then closed the loop."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:35–0:52)

"If I could go back to being a student:

I'd practice saying 'I don't know' in class. Out loud. In front of people.

I'd train myself to see it as a STRENGTH, not a weakness.

And I'd build the habit of following up. Because 'I don't know' without follow-up is just ignorance. 'I don't know, but here's what I found out' — that's leadership.

The best engineers I've ever worked with — principal, staff, directors — all of them are comfortable saying 'I don't know.' The worst ones never admit it."

---

## THE PUNCHLINE (0:52–1:05)

"New engineers try to look smart.

Senior engineers try to be USEFUL.

There's a massive difference."

---

## CTA (1:05–1:15)

"Part 8 of 10. Three more to go — follow so you don't miss them."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Contrast):**
"New engineers try to look smart. Senior engineers say 'I don't know.' Here's why that works better."

**Option B (Story):**
"The best engineer on my team said 'I don't know' more than anyone else. He got promoted first."

**Option C (Direct):**
"'I don't know, but I'll find out by Friday.' That sentence built more trust than any code I ever shipped."

## CAPTION

"The best engineer on my team said 'I don't know' more than anyone. He also got promoted first. Part 8 of 10 🎓🧠 #humility #engineering #leadership #staffengineer #scrummaster #careeradvice #LaunchToLead"

## POSTING NOTES

- "I don't know, but I'll find out by Friday" should be said clearly and slowly — like you're modeling the exact tone to use
- The fake-it vs. silence contrast needs distinct energy — nervous/confident vs. shrinking
- "New engineers try to look smart. Senior engineers try to be useful." — let it breathe
- Pin comment: "When was the last time you said 'I don't know' at work? How did it go? 👇"
