## HOOK (0:00–0:04)

"As an Engineering Manager, here's the skill that determined who got promoted. It wasn't code."

---

## THE REVEAL (0:04–0:15)

"It was the ability to give feedback without making it personal. And receive feedback without getting defensive.

That's it. That one skill separated the people who grew fast from the people who plateaued."

---

## THE GIVING SIDE (0:15–0:30)

"Giving feedback. Most new engineers either avoid it completely — and resentment builds — or they dump it all at once and it sounds like an attack.

There's a middle ground:

'Hey — I noticed the test coverage on this PR is lower than usual. Was that intentional, or do you want a hand adding some?'

That's it. Specific. Not personal. Offers help. Takes 10 seconds.

As a scrum master, I watched teams implode because nobody could say this sentence."

---

## THE RECEIVING SIDE (0:30–0:48)

"Receiving feedback is harder.

Your code review comes back with 15 comments. Your gut says: 'They think I'm stupid.'

No. They think the code can be better. Those are different things.

When I was a manager, the engineers who said 'Oh interesting — tell me more about why you'd do it that way' got promoted.

The ones who got defensive, argued in the comments, or went silent? They stalled. Every time."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:48–1:05)

"If I could go back to school:

I'd ask professors for feedback on things that WEREN'T graded. Just to practice hearing it.

I'd peer review classmates' work and practice being constructive.

I'd train myself to hear 'your work needs improvement' without hearing 'you're not good enough.'

Because that reframe? It's worth more than any technical skill you'll learn."

## CTA (1:05–1:15)

"Part 5 of 10. Follow if you want the uncomfortable truths."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Direct):**
"The fastest way to get promoted in engineering? It's not better code. It's better feedback."

**Option B (Story):**
"I had two engineers with identical skills. One got promoted in 18 months. One took 4 years. The difference? How they handled feedback."

**Option C (Question):**
"Can you hear 'this could be better' without hearing 'you're not good enough'? That skill changes everything."

## POSTING NOTES

- The PR feedback example should be said casually — like you're modeling the tone
- "They think I'm stupid" should be said with slight self-awareness, like you've felt this too
- The "tell me more" vs "defensive in the comments" contrast needs a beat between them
- Pin comment: "What's the hardest piece of feedback you've ever received at work? 👇"
