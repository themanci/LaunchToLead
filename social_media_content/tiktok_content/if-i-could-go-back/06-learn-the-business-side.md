## HOOK (0:00–0:04)

"I was a Product Owner for a year. It completely changed how I see engineering."

---

## THE WAKE-UP (0:04–0:18)

"When I was an engineer, I'd get a ticket. Build the thing. Ship it. Move on.

I never once asked: 'Why are we building this? Who's it for? What happens to revenue if we DON'T build it?'

Then I became a Product Owner. And suddenly I was the one deciding WHAT gets built and WHY.

And I realized — most engineers have no idea why they're building what they're building."

---

## WHY IT MATTERS (0:18–0:35)

"Here's the thing. The engineers who understood the business were 10x more valuable.

Not because they coded better. Because they'd push back: 'Hey, this feature won't move the metric you care about. What if we did THIS instead?'

That's a Staff Engineer move. That's a principal engineer move.

And it starts with understanding a P&L statement, knowing what ARR means, understanding customer pain — things engineering school never touches."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:35–0:55)

"If I could go back:

I'd take one business class. Just one. Marketing, finance, product management — pick one.

I'd read about the companies I wanted to work at — not their tech stack, their BUSINESS MODEL. How do they make money? Who's their customer? What's their competitive advantage?

I'd stop thinking of myself as 'the person who builds things' and start thinking 'the person who solves business problems with technology.'

That reframe is the difference between a senior engineer and a staff engineer."

---

## THE PUNCHLINE (0:55–1:05)

"Code is a tool. The business problem is the job.

The sooner you understand that, the faster you'll grow."

---

## CTA (1:05–1:15)

"Part 6 of 10. This is the stuff nobody tells you in school — follow."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Challenge):**
"Can you explain how your company makes money? If not, you're missing the biggest lever in your career."

**Option B (Bold):**
"The engineers who get promoted to Staff aren't the best coders. They're the ones who understand the business."

**Option C (Story):**
"I went from building tickets to deciding what gets built. That shift changed everything."

## POSTING NOTES

- "Why are we building this?" should sound genuinely curious — like you never thought to ask
- Speed up through the "what I'd do differently" list — conviction energy
- "Code is a tool. The business problem is the job." — slow down, look directly at camera
- Pin comment: "Do you know how your company (or dream company) actually makes money? Real talk 👇"
