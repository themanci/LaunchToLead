# If I Could Go Back #10 — I'd Build Relationships With People 2-3 Years Ahead of Me

**Series:** 10 Things I'd Do Differently as an Engineering Student
**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length:** 75–100 seconds
**Style:** Talking head, direct to camera, reflective/closing energy
**Role POV:** Staff Engineer — 8 years across engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, software development enablement leader

## HOOK (0:00–0:05)

"Stop networking with executives. Start networking with the person two years ahead of you."

---

## THE MISTAKE (0:05–0:18)

"When people told me to 'network,' I thought that meant LinkedIn-messaging VPs at companies I wanted to work at.

Cold messages. Awkward coffee chats. Trying to impress people who had zero reason to care about me.

It never worked. Because I was trying to leap 15 years of career in one conversation."

---

## THE BETTER PLAY (0:18–0:38)

"Here's what actually changed my career:

Talking to the person who JUST went through what I was about to go through.

When I was a student — talking to a new grad engineer six months into their first job. They remembered what interviews were actually like. They remembered which classes mattered and which didn't.

When I went from engineer to scrum master — talking to someone who'd made that switch a year ago. 'What surprised you? What do you wish you'd known?'

When I moved into management — same thing. When I moved to Staff — same thing.

Every transition in my career — engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, enablement leader — was smoother because someone slightly ahead of me was willing to share what they'd learned."

---

## WHY 2-3 YEARS (0:38–0:52)

"Why 2-3 years and not 10-15?

Because someone 2 years ahead still remembers the DETAILS. They remember the specific rejection that stung. The question they bombed. The thing they didn't know. The moment it clicked.

Someone 15 years ahead? They've forgotten. Their advice is too abstract. 'Just work hard and be curious.' Thanks, that's not actionable.

The person slightly ahead gives you a roadmap in real-time."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:52–1:08)

"If I could go back:

I'd find three to five people who graduated one to three years before me. Same major. Same career path I wanted.

I'd ask them ONE question: 'What do you wish you'd known when you were where I am right now?'

And I'd meet with them quarterly. Not to ask for a job. Not to 'network.' Just to learn from someone who's a few steps ahead on the same trail.

That's the highest-ROI relationship an engineering student can build."

---

## THE SERIES CLOSE (1:08–1:25)

"That's number ten. Ten things I'd do differently.

I've been an engineer, a scrum master, a product owner, an engineering manager, a Staff Engineer, and a software development enablement leader.

Eight years, six roles, and one lesson weaved through all of them:

The technical stuff matters. But it's the HUMAN stuff — the writing, the feedback, the communication, the relationships — that determines how far you actually go.

Start working on the human stuff now. Don't wait until you're eight years in like I did."

---

## CTA (1:25–1:35)

"That's the full series. If any of these hit, follow — I post career advice for engineers who want to do this intentionally.

And if you want help building your job search strategy — link in bio."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Story):**
"The best career advice I ever got came from someone who graduated two years before me. Not a VP. Not a professor. A 24-year-old with a real job."

**Option B (Counterintuitive):**
"LinkedIn told me to network UP. That was terrible advice. Here's what works instead."

**Option C (Direct):**
"The most useful mentor isn't 20 years ahead of you. They're 2. Here's why."

## CAPTION

"8 years. 6 roles. 10 lessons. If I could do it all over — I'd start with the human stuff. This is the final one. Thank you for following along. 🎓🤝 #networking #mentorship #engineeringstudent #staffengineer #careeradvice #seriescomplete #LaunchToLead"

## POSTING NOTES

- This is the series finale — energy should feel reflective, not hype
- The rapid role list (engineer → scrum master → PO → manager → staff → enablement) should be delivered with weight, not speed — each role matters
- "The technical stuff matters. But it's the HUMAN stuff..." — this is the thesis of the entire series. Let it breathe.
- The CTA is soft — don't hard-sell. This should feel like a genuine close.
