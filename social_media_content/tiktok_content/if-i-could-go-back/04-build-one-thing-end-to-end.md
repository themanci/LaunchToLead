# If I Could Go Back #4 — I'd Build One Thing End-to-End Instead of 10 Half-Finished Projects

**Series:** 10 Things I'd Do Differently as an Engineering Student
**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length:** 60–90 seconds
**Style:** Talking head, direct to camera
**Role POV:** Staff Engineer — 8 years across engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, software development enablement leader

## HOOK (0:00–0:04)

"Your GitHub full of half-finished projects is hurting you. Here's what to do instead."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:04–0:18)

"When I was a student, I had twelve side projects. A weather app. A to-do list. A half-built chatbot. A portfolio site I never finished.

Twelve repos. Zero of them deployed. Zero used by anyone. Zero that I could explain end-to-end in an interview.

I had breadth. I had zero depth."

---

## THE STAFF ENGINEER PERSPECTIVE (0:18–0:35)

"As a Staff Engineer, my job is systems thinking. How does the frontend talk to the API? How does the API talk to the database? What happens when the database goes down at 2 AM? Who gets paged? What's the rollback plan?

That's not something you learn from tutorials. That's something you learn by OWNING something from idea to deployment to 'oh no it's broken in production.'

One project. All the way through."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:35–0:55)

"If I could go back, I'd pick ONE project and go absurdly deep.

Requirements — like a product owner would write them.
Architecture — diagrammed, not just in my head.
Build it. Deploy it somewhere real. Not localhost.
Monitor it. Set up alerts. Watch it break.
Iterate. Get feedback from a real user. Ship version 2.

That one project teaches you more than a CS degree about how software actually works in the real world."

---

## THE PUNCHLINE (0:55–1:05)

"In interviews, I don't ask 'how many projects have you done?'

I ask 'tell me about something you built and owned.'

Depth wins. Every time."

---

## CTA (1:05–1:15)

"Part 4 of 10. This series is for engineers who want the real playbook — follow."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Stat Feel):**
"I had 12 GitHub repos as a student. All half-finished. Here's what I should've done."

**Option B (Question):**
"What's more impressive — 12 tutorial projects or 1 app that's actually deployed and used?"

**Option C (Pattern Interrupt):**
"Stop building to-do apps. Build something that breaks at 2 AM and you have to fix it."

## TEXT OVERLAY SEQUENCE

- 0:00 — "Half-finished projects are HURTING you"
- 0:06 — "12 repos. 0 deployed. 0 users."
- 0:18 — "Staff Engineers think in SYSTEMS"
- 0:25 — "Frontend → API → Database → Monitoring → Rollback"
- 0:35 — "WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY"
- 0:38 — "Requirements → Architecture → Build → Deploy → Monitor → Iterate"
- 0:55 — "Depth > Breadth. Every time."

## CAPTION

"12 half-finished GitHub projects taught me nothing. One end-to-end project would've taught me everything. Part 4 of 10 🎓🔧 #sideproject #github #softwareengineering #staffengineer #systemsthinking #LaunchToLead"

## POSTING NOTES

- List the 12 half-projects fast — almost like you're embarrassed by them
- The "idea to deployment to 'oh no it's broken'" line should escalate in energy
- The requirements → deploy → monitor list should be counted on fingers
- Pin comment: "What's the ONE project you'd go deep on if you started over? Drop it 👇"
