**Series:** 10 Things I'd Do Differently as an Engineering Student
**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length:** 60–90 seconds
**Style:** Talking head, direct to camera, intense eye contact
**Role POV:** Staff Engineer — 8 years across engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, software development enablement leader

## HOOK (0:00–0:04)

"I've interviewed over 200 engineers. Not ONE time have I asked for someone's GPA."

---

## THE REALITY (0:04–0:20)

"Eight years. Six different roles. Engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, enablement leader.

You know what I've asked in every single interview?

'Tell me about a time when…'

That's it. Every. Single. Round."

---

## THE MISTAKE (0:20–0:35)

"When I was a student, I spent weekends grinding problem sets alone to protect a 3.8.

Meanwhile, the kid who led that chaotic group project — the one where two teammates ghosted and the deadline moved twice — she had a STORY.

Conflict. Adaptation. Leadership under pressure.

That story got her the job. My GPA got me… nothing."

---

## THE SHIFT (0:35–0:55)

"If I could go back, I'd volunteer for every messy group project. Every leadership role in a student org. Every situation that could go sideways.

Not because I love chaos.

Because interviews don't test what you KNOW. They test what you've DONE. And more importantly — what you learned from it.

A 3.4 with five killer stories beats a 4.0 with nothing to talk about. Every time."

## CTA (0:55–1:05)

"This is part one of ten — things I'd do differently if I could go back to being an engineering student. Follow for the rest."

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Pattern Interrupt):**
"Your GPA is a vanity metric. Here's what actually matters."

**Option B (Curiosity Gap):**
"I've been on both sides of the hiring table for 8 years. Here's what I wish I'd known as a student."

**Option C (Bold Claim):**
"The 3.4 student with stories will beat the 4.0 student without them. Every single time."

## POSTING NOTES

- Open with intensity — this is the series opener, set the tone
- Count off the roles fast to establish credibility immediately
