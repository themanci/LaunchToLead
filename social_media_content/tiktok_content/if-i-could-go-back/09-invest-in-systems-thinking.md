# If I Could Go Back #9 — I'd Invest in Systems Thinking, Not Just Coding

**Series:** 10 Things I'd Do Differently as an Engineering Student
**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Length:** 60–90 seconds
**Style:** Talking head, direct to camera, thoughtful pacing
**Role POV:** Staff Engineer — 8 years across engineer, scrum master, product owner, engineering manager, staff engineer, software development enablement leader

## HOOK (0:00–0:05)

"LeetCode didn't make me a Staff Engineer. Understanding how systems FAIL did."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:05–0:18)

"As a student, I thought being a great engineer meant writing great code.

Clean functions. Elegant algorithms. Passing all the tests.

And yeah — that matters at the junior level.

But nobody told me that as you move up, the job stops being about code and starts being about SYSTEMS."

---

## WHAT STAFF ENGINEERS ACTUALLY DO (0:18–0:35)

"Here's what a Staff Engineer thinks about on a Monday morning:

If this service goes down, what cascades? Which teams are affected? What's the blast radius?

Can this database handle 10x the traffic if we land that enterprise client next quarter?

If Team A ships their change on Tuesday and Team B ships theirs on Wednesday — do those interact? Does anything break?

That's not coding. That's systems thinking. It's seeing the connections between things. The second and third-order effects.

And I had ZERO training for this in school."

---

## WHAT I'D DO DIFFERENTLY (0:35–0:55)

"If I could go back:

I'd take distributed systems seriously — not as an elective to survive, but as the foundation of my career.

I'd study how databases talk to caches, how caches talk to APIs, how APIs talk to frontends, and what happens when ANY of those connections break.

I'd read post-mortems from real companies. Google, Netflix, Cloudflare — they publish them. Free masterclasses in how systems fail.

I'd think less about 'can I solve this problem?' and more about 'what happens to the rest of the system when this problem gets solved?'"

---

## THE PUNCHLINE (0:55–1:08)

"Junior engineers write code.

Senior engineers design components.

Staff engineers see the whole system — every dependency, every failure mode, every ripple effect.

Start seeing systems now. Don't wait eight years like I did."

---

## CTA (1:08–1:15)

"Part 9 of 10. One more after this. Follow."

---

## HOOK ALTERNATIVES

**Option A (Contrast):**
"Junior engineers ask 'does this work?' Staff engineers ask 'what breaks when this works?'"

**Option B (Bold):**
"I grinded LeetCode for months. The skill that actually got me to Staff? Understanding how things break."

**Option C (Curiosity):**
"What does a Staff Engineer think about that a junior doesn't? It's not code. It's this."

## CAPTION

"LeetCode got me interviews. Systems thinking got me to Staff. If I could go back, I'd study how things BREAK, not just how to build them. Part 9 of 10 🎓⚙️ #systemsthinking #staffengineer #distributedsystems #softwareengineering #careeradvice #LaunchToLead"

## POSTING NOTES

- The "Monday morning" scenario should be delivered like you're thinking out loud — not scripted
- The cascade of "databases → caches → APIs → frontends → break" should flow fast, like a chain reaction
- The three-level punchline (junior/senior/staff) should escalate — each level slightly more intense
- Pin comment: "What's the biggest system failure you've witnessed or read about? Drop it 👇"
