## Talking Points

### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
- Was coaching someone last week with an offer on the table
- New company, exciting opportunity, better role
- But they couldn't pull the trigger
- Their mind was racing with "what ifs"

### THE WHAT IFS (0:15-0:35)
- What if I get laid off in a year?
- What if the new company isn't stable?
- What if I regret leaving big company comfort?
- What if it doesn't pan out?
- These fears were PARALYZING them
- The current employer had stability, benefits, room to grow
- That comfort was keeping them scared

### THE PROBLEM (0:35-0:55)
- Most people stop at the "what if"
- They let it hang there as this looming monster
- Abstract fears in your head = terrifying
- But here's the thing: they never ANSWER the question
- They just leave it as this unknown scary thing

### THE EXERCISE (0:55-1:20)
- I told them: write down every "what if"
- Then ANSWER each one
- Don't just acknowledge it—follow it to the end
- Ask: "Okay, so what? Then what happens?"
- And keep going: "And then what? And then what?"

### THE EXAMPLE (1:20-2:00)
- "What if I get laid off in a year?"
- Okay, so what? Then what happens?
- "I'd have to find another job"
- Do you have an emergency fund?
- "Yeah, 6-9 months saved"
- So your family won't be homeless. You won't be under a bridge.
- Could you find a job in that time?
- "Yeah, I have skills and a network"
- Could you go back to your old employer if you left on good terms?
- "Probably, yeah"
- So... what exactly is the catastrophe here?

### THE REALIZATION (2:00-2:25)
- When you follow the chain to the end, you realize:
  - You're not going to be homeless
  - Your life isn't going to end
  - The worst case is survivable
  - The fear was bigger than reality
- The vague fear is ALWAYS scarier than the specific answer

### CTA (2:25-2:40)
- Next time you're stuck on a decision
- Write down your "what ifs"
- Answer each one: "So what? Then what?"
- Follow the chain to the end
- See how small they really are
