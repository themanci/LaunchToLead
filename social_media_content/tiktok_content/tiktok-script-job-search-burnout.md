# TikTok Video Script - Job Search Burnout

**Duration:** 2:45

---

## SCENE 1: HOOK (0-3 seconds)

**[Sitting at desk, tired expression]**

**YOU:** "You've been job searching for a month. You're freaking out. Nothing's working. But here's the thing..."

**[Lean in]**

**YOU:** "You're actually right on pace."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "The Median Job Search: 68 DAYS"]**

---

## SCENE 2: THE CYCLE (4-30 seconds)

**[Quick cuts between different scenes/expressions]**

**YOU (voiceover):** "Here's what's actually happening:"

**[TEXT: "WEEK 1-2: OPTIMISM"]**  
**YOU:** "Week 1-2, you're optimistic. Apply everywhere. Energy is high. ✅"

**[Quick transition]**

**[TEXT: "WEEK 3-6: PANIC"]**  
**YOU:** "Week 3-6, few responses. You panic. You apply MORE, not smarter. 😰"

**[Quick transition]**

**[TEXT: "WEEK 7-10: DESPERATION"]**  
**YOU:** "Week 7-10, you're applying to anything. Generic cover letters. Motivation is gone. 😩"

**[Quick transition]**

**[TEXT: "WEEK 11+: BURNOUT"]**  
**YOU:** "Week 11 and beyond... burnout. Checking email constantly. Doubting yourself."

**[Pause, point at camera]**

**YOU:** "Sound familiar?"

---

## SCENE 3: THE PROBLEM (31-50 seconds)

**[Back at desk, serious tone]**

**YOU:** "The problem? You sprinted a marathon. Here's why people actually burn out:"

**[TEXT appears as you speak]**

**YOU:** "One: Spray-and-pray. 100 applications = 2 responses. Brutal ROI.

Two: No tracking. You don't know where you stand, so you're anxious forever.

Three: Obsessive checking. Refreshing email isn't progress.

Four: You're doing it alone. Every rejection feels personal."

---

## SCENE 4: THE FIX (51-2:20 seconds)

**[Energy shift - standing, more animated]**

**YOU:** "But here's the good news. The fix is NOT motivation. It's systems."

**[TEXT: "4 SYSTEMS THAT WORK"]**

**YOU:** "Number one: Pick 10-15 target companies instead of 100 random ones. Better odds, less mental drain."

**[Quick cut to typing on computer]**

**YOU:** "Number two: Build a simple spreadsheet. Company. Role. Stage. Next action. Update weekly. Boom. Anxiety gone."

**[Quick cut back]**

**YOU:** "Number three: Time-box your search. 9 to 11 AM, 2 to 4 PM. Then stop. Your brain needs rest."

**[Quick cut]**

**YOU:** "Number four: Find an accountability buddy. Weekly check-ins. Share wins, share struggles. You're not alone."

---

## SCENE 5: CLOSER (2:21-2:45 seconds)

**[Direct to camera, confident]**

**YOU:** "68 days is totally winnable. But only if you pace yourself like a 10-week project, not a 10-day sprint."

**[TEXT: "SYSTEMS > MOTIVATION"]**  
**[TEXT: "CONSISTENCY > INTENSITY"]**  
**[TEXT: "COMMUNITY > ISOLATION"]**

**YOU:** "Your job is on the other side of week 10. You just have to pace yourself."

**[Smile, point at camera]**

**YOU:** "You've got this."

**[TEXT OVERLAY: "Build your system. Pace yourself. 💪"]**

## PRODUCTION NOTES:

- **Music:** Upbeat but not too intense (trending TikTok audio)
- **Pacing:** Fast cuts during burnout cycle section to show chaos. Slower, calmer during the fix section.
- **Transitions:** Quick wipes or text transitions between scenes
- **On-screen text:** Keep it simple, readable, use contrasting colors
- **Visuals:** Mix of desk setup, typing, pointing at camera, walking
- **Tone:** Start tired/concerned, shift to hopeful/energetic by the end
- **Hook:** First 3 seconds are make-or-break—nail the tired-but-hope vibe
