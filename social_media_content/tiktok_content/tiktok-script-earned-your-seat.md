## HOOK (0:00-0:05)

*Direct to camera, calm*

"You're at the starting line now. Forget about how you got here."

---

## THE SETUP (0:05-0:25)

*Walk around or stay put, matter-of-fact*

"Maybe you took a different path. Maybe you're older than others on your team. Maybe you didn't go to the right school.

That story's over."

---

## THE REALITY CHECK (0:25-0:40)

*Stop, look at camera*

"Someone chose you for this role. You didn't sneak in the door.

You earned it."

---

## THE SHIFT (0:40-1:00)

*Emphasize this part*

"This isn't about benevolence. This isn't because they felt bad for you.

You earned your spot. You belong here.

And the fact that you're here proves it."

---

## THE MOVE (1:00-1:25)

*Direct, energetic but not over the top*

"Stop the self-doubt. Stop second-guessing yourself.

You can't control your past. You can't control what might happen tomorrow that's out of your hands.

But you CAN control how hard you work.

And no one can take that from you."

---

## THE POWER MOVE (1:25-1:50)

*Intense, but grounded*

"Your unorthodox path? That's not a weakness.

That's your advantage.

Outwork everyone. For the next 10 years, make it non-negotiable.

You won't just be where you think you should be.

You'll be way past it."

---

## CTA (1:50-2:00)

*Back to calm, direct*

"You earned your seat at the table.

Now earn everything that comes after by doing the work."
