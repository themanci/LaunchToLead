## SCRIPT

**[HOOK - First 1-2 seconds]**
"Stop asking 'What's the company culture like?'"

---

**[PATTERN INTERRUPT - Seconds 2-5]**
"That question tells them nothing about you — and tells you nothing useful about them."

"Here are the 3 questions I tell every engineer to ask instead."

---

**[QUESTION 1 - Seconds 5-15]**
"Number one: 'Are there any gaps in my qualifications that might make this role more challenging for me?'"

"Yes, it's uncomfortable. That's why it works."

"You're giving them permission to voice concerns — and giving yourself a chance to handle them before you leave the room."

---

**[QUESTION 2 - Seconds 15-25]**
"Number two: 'What does your onboarding or training process look like?'"

"This tells you if they actually invest in new hires — or if they're gonna throw you in the deep end with no support."

"If they stumble on this one? Red flag."

---

**[QUESTION 3 - Seconds 25-35]**
"Number three: 'What tools or technologies will I be working with day-to-day?'"

"Simple. Practical. Shows you're already thinking about the work."

---

**[THE REFRAME - Seconds 35-45]**
"Why only three?"

"For a phone screen, three is enough. More than that and you seem difficult. Less than that and you seem unprepared."

"Your goal right now isn't to interrogate them. It's to get an offer."

"Once you HAVE the offer — that's when you ask everything. Leave no stone unturned."

---

**[CLOSE - Seconds 45-50]**
"But you can't negotiate from a position of strength until you have an offer in hand."

"Get the offer first."

**Title:**
3 Questions to Ask at the End of Every Interview (That Actually Work)

**Description:**
Stop asking generic questions like "What's the company culture like?" Here are the 3 strategic questions I coach engineers to ask instead — and why they work.

1. "Are there any gaps in my qualifications?"
2. "What's your onboarding/training process?"
3. "What tools will I work with day-to-day?"

Your goal is to get the offer FIRST. Once you have the offer, that's when you grill them.

### INSTAGRAM REELS

**Caption:**
Stop asking "What's the company culture like?" 🛑

That question tells them nothing about you — and tells you nothing useful.

Here are the 3 questions I tell every engineer to ask instead:

1️⃣ "Are there any gaps in my qualifications that might make this role challenging?"
2️⃣ "What does your onboarding or training process look like?"
3️⃣ "What tools or technologies will I work with day-to-day?"

Why only 3? For a phone screen, 3 is enough. Your goal right now is to get the offer — THEN you can ask everything.

Save this for your next interview 📌

### FACEBOOK REELS

**Caption:**
"Do you have any questions for us?"

Don't ask about culture. Don't ask what they like about working there.

Ask these 3 instead:

1. "Are there any gaps in my qualifications?" — Lets you address concerns before you leave
2. "What's your onboarding process?" — Reveals if they invest in new hires or throw you in the deep end
3. "What tools will I use day-to-day?" — Shows you're already thinking about the work

3 questions. That's it. Get the offer first — then ask everything.

Why these 3?

→ Q1 lets you address concerns before you leave the room
→ Q2 reveals if they invest in new hires or throw you in the deep end
→ Q3 shows you're already thinking about the work

Your goal is to GET the offer. Once you have it — that's when you grill them on everything else.
