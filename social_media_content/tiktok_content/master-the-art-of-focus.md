# Master the Art of Focus - TikTok Script

**Duration:** ~90 seconds

---

## HOOK (0-5 sec)
*Look directly at camera, slightly intense*

"The one skill that would've changed my entire college career... and nobody taught me."

---

## PROBLEM (5-25 sec)

"When I was in college, I thought I was studying. I wasn't.

I was at the library with my friends—talking.

I was checking my phone every 20 minutes.

I was staying up late when my brain was already fried.

I was putting off work to go to the gym or grab lunch.

I was doing everything BUT focusing."

---

## THE TRUTH (25-45 sec)

"Now everyone wants a productivity hack. Some magic system.

Here's the truth:

There is no hack.

There is only focus.

And focus is a skill. You have to train it like a muscle."

---

## THE FIX (45-70 sec)

"Here's how:

One—remove ALL distractions. Your phone, your music, everything.

Two—go into a room alone. Close the door.

Three—set a timer. NOT on your phone. A real timer.

Four—just do it.

Start with one hour. Just one.

Then build up. Two hours. Three. Four.

Four-hour focused blocks will change your life."

---

## CLOSE (70-90 sec)

"And here's what nobody tells you—

Eventually? The focused work sessions become your dopamine hit.

Imagine being as addicted to getting stuff done as you are to checking your phone.

You would be... unstoppable."

*Hold eye contact for 2 seconds*
