## HOOK (0:00-0:05)

*Direct to camera, conversational*

"I found something that actually makes interview stories hit different."

---

## PROBLEM (0:05-0:20)

*Walk around, casual*

"So everyone knows STAR—situation, task, action, result. It's solid.

But most people end it there.

And I get it—you're just running through your wins. Nothing wrong with that. But what if there was something more?"

---

## THE MISSING PIECE (0:20-0:30)

*Stop, turn to camera, friendly*

"What I've noticed with my clients:

The ones who land the jobs? They add one more thing.

They add the L.

Lessons Learned.

Just tell them what you actually learned from it."

---

## WHY IT MATTERS (0:30-0:50)

*Talking head, genuine*

"Here's why it actually works.

Because you're not just showing past performance—you're showing that you grow.

You're showing you actually think about your work.

That you learn from stuff.

And that's what hiring managers are actually looking for."

---

## HOW TO DO IT (0:50-1:15)

*Casual, encouraging*

"It's so simple too.

After your result, just add one sentence:

'What I learned was...' 

Or 'This taught me...'

Could be about the project. Could be about yourself. Could be something about your team.

Just keep it real. That's literally it."

---

## PROOF (1:15-1:30)

*Back to camera, warm*

"I've seen clients go from struggling to landing senior roles just by doing this.

Not because their stories got better on paper.

But because they sound more like actual humans.

People who actually reflect on what they do."

---

## CTA (1:30-1:40)

*Friendly, conversational*

"So try it next time you're in an interview. Add that L.

See if it feels different.

And follow if you want more stuff like this."
