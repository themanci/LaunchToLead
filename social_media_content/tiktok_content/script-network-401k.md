# TikTok Script: Your Network is a 401k

## Duration: ~60-90 seconds

---

### HOOK (0-5 sec)
**[Look directly at camera, conversational tone]**

"Your network is a 401k. Let me explain."

---

### THE ANALOGY (5-25 sec)

"When you put your first fifty bucks into a retirement account, it feels like nothing. You check it a month later — still nothing. Six months — barely moved."

"Building your network feels the exact same way."

"Year one, you meet a bunch of people. Nothing happens. Year three, you've had some coffee chats, added some people on LinkedIn. Still feels pointless."

---

### THE COMPOUND MOMENT (25-45 sec)

"But then year five hits, and someone you barely remember from a career fair three years ago refers you for a job."

"Year ten? You've got an army. People who answer your random questions at 11pm. People who make introductions without you even asking. People who tell you the truth when you need to hear it."

"That's compound interest. That's what happens when you keep making deposits."

---

### THE FLIP (45-60 sec)

"But here's the part nobody talks about — the best part isn't what you GET. It's what you get to GIVE."

"You become the mentor you needed ten years ago. The person who opens doors. The friend who picks up on the first ring."

---

### CLOSE (60-75 sec)

"Every coffee chat is a deposit. Every genuine follow-up is interest earned. Every time you ask someone 'how can I help?' — that's reinvesting your dividends."

"But it only compounds if you start."

**[Pause, lean in slightly]**

"So start planting. The harvest comes later."
