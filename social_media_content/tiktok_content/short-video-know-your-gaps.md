## Talking Points

### HOOK (0:00-0:15)
- Friend coaches engineers at Amazon/Microsoft (senior, staff, principal level)
- He asked me: "Why can't anyone tell me what their gaps are?"
- When he asks what they need to work on → silence

### THE PROBLEM (0:15-0:35)
- Smart, successful people who know they're stuck
- But they can't articulate *what's* wrong
- "I'm stuck" / "I'm not growing" / "Didn't get promoted" → symptoms, not gaps
- If you can't describe the problem, you're not at zero—you're in the negative

### WHY THIS MATTERS (0:35-0:55)
- Coach can't fix what you can't describe
- You'll waste sessions just figuring out the problem
- Expensive, slow, avoidable

### STEP 1: MINE YOUR FEEDBACK (0:55-1:25)
- You already have data—use it
- Look at performance reviews for recurring themes
- What do managers consistently say?
- What patterns follow you across jobs?
- If 3 managers said the same thing... it's probably you

### STEP 2: PUSH FOR FEEDBACK (1:25-1:55)
- "My manager never gives me feedback" → that's a problem too
- Ask directly: "What's ONE thing I should work on for the next level?"
- Make it impossible to dodge
- If they can't answer → they're not paying attention or not doing their job

### STEP 3: 360 FEEDBACK (1:55-2:25)
- Get perspective from all directions:
  - Seniors: "What would you improve if you were me?"
  - Peers: "What patterns do you notice?"
  - Juniors: "How could I support you better?"
- Different levels see different blind spots

### WHY PEOPLE SKIP THIS (2:25-2:45)
- Never ask for feedback
- Dismiss it as biased/unfair
- Hear it but don't internalize
- Scared of what they'll learn
- Discomfort now < years of stagnation

### CTA (2:45-3:00)
- Know your gaps before you get a coach
- Know where you want to grow
- Know what's holding you back
- Then make coaching count

## YouTube Title Options

1. Why Most Engineers Aren't Ready for Coaching (Do This First)
2. Know Your Gaps Before You Get a Coach
3. The #1 Mistake Engineers Make When Seeking Mentorship
4. You're Not Ready for a Coach Until You Do This

## YouTube Description

A friend who coaches engineers at Amazon and Microsoft told me something that stuck with me: most people can't articulate their own gaps.

If you can't describe what's holding you back, you're not at zero—you're in the negative.

In this video, I'll show you how to identify your gaps BEFORE you seek coaching:
- How to mine your existing feedback for patterns
- What to do if you're not getting feedback
- How to do a 360° feedback exercise
- Why most people avoid this (and why that keeps them stuck)

Don't show up to coaching empty-handed.
