# X Post: Be the Student They Remember

---

**MAIN POST:**

Most college students never introduce themselves to their professors.

Sit in the front row. Go to office hours. Build a real relationship.

Professors give recommendations, job leads, and guidance to students they actually know.

Be the student they remember.

**REPLY POST (post immediately after):**

I had a study group in a Physics class. We kept going to the professor's office hours before an exam.

One of us couldn't solve a certain type of problem. After helping us so many times, the professor smiled and said, "I wouldn't worry too much about this type of problem for the exam."

That hint saved my friend a week of stress. He redirected his energy to what actually mattered and crushed the exam.

That only happened because we showed up.
