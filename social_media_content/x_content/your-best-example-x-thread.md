**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Your best interview answer might come from a retail job.

Not a Fortune 500 project.
Not a technical presentation.
Not your engineering capstone.

Here's what happened in a coaching session yesterday:

**Tweet 2 (The Setup):**
I asked a behavioral question:

"Tell me about a time you adapted your communication style for a different audience."

My client hesitated.

"I have an example, but I don't think it counts... it's not really technical."

**Tweet 3 (The Example):**
Their example:

Training a coworker on the autism spectrum at a previous job to complete a specific task.

My response: "That's one of the BEST examples I've heard."

Here's why most people get this wrong 👇

**Tweet 4 (The Problem):**
Most candidates think "adapting communication" means:

→ Presenting to marketing
→ Explaining code to your manager
→ Dumbing down your capstone

Those work. But they're also what EVERYONE says.

This example? That showed something different.

**Tweet 5 (The Depth):**
That example demonstrated:

• Real empathy (not performative)
• Genuine observation of how someone learns
• Adapting WITHOUT condescension
• Real-time adjustment
• Actually caring about the outcome for THEM

That's MORE competency than "I presented to a non-technical panel."

**Tweet 6 (The Takeaway + CTA):**
Communication isn't "explaining things simply."

It's connecting with anyone—regardless of how they process information.

Stop dismissing your "unconventional" examples.

The story you think is "too small" might be the one that sets you apart.

What example have you been hesitant to use? 👇
