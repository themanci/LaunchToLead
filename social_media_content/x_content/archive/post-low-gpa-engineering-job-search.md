# X Post: Low GPA? Here's How to Own It

---

**SINGLE POST:**

Worried your low GPA will tank your engineering job search?

Use the A-B-C framework:

A - Acknowledge: "My GPA is 2.6 due to early circumstances."
B - Bridge: "But I've improved significantly."
C - Capability: "I earned A's in my hardest courses and gained real experience."

Own it. Don't hide it. Show growth.

After your first job, no one cares about GPA anyway.
