**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

Career fairs make you sweat bullets.
Networking events make you want to hide.
Talking about yourself feels painful.

Sound familiar?

Here's how to network as an introvert 🧵

**Tweet 2:**

First, accept this:

You won't magically become an extrovert.

That's not the goal.

The goal is to stretch those muscles until uncomfortable becomes manageable.

The only way to get better? Do it anyway. Repeatedly.

Tip #1: Practice makes progress

Every awkward conversation is training.
Every uncomfortable event is a rep at the gym.

You're building a skill. Skills require reps.

I was super introverted until I decided enough was enough and started forcing myself into social situations.

Tip #2: Set SPECIFIC goals

❌ "I want to network more"
❌ "I want to be more social"

These aren't goals. They're wishes.

Vague intentions don't force you out of your comfort zone.

Specific targets do.

**Tweet 5:**

Real networking goals look like this:

→ "5 new LinkedIn connections per week"
→ "Professor office hours once a week"
→ "1 new contact from each SI session"
→ "Join 1 student org, meet 10 people this semester"
→ "Introduce myself to 1 new person in my dorm weekly"
→ "Join Toastmasters"

Tip #3: Start with your passions

It's 10x easier to be social about things you actually care about.

Join clubs that matter to you.
Meet people in contexts you enjoy.
Talk about topics that excite you.

Passion makes conversation flow naturally.

**Tweet 7:**

Reality check:

If you're in an interview and you're so shy it's hard to communicate with you...

How high will they rank you on "works well with others"?

Communication skills aren't optional.
Networking isn't optional.

But both are learnable.

Quick recap:

1. Practice makes progress—do it anyway
2. Set specific goals—not wishes
3. Start with passions—it's easier
