# What Would You Do Differently - X Strategy

---

## MOST EFFECTIVE FORMAT: Single Tweet (Not a Thread)

Threads are dying on X. Single tweets with strong hooks get more impressions, quote-tweets, and replies.

---

## OPTION A: The Bold Claim (Recommended)

The best interview answer isn't the one they ask for.

It's the one they were ABOUT to ask for.

Every behavioral question has a follow-up:
"What would you do differently?"

Don't wait for them to ask it.
Answer it before they do.

That's how you go from "good candidate" to "the one they remember."

---

## OPTION B: The Pattern Interrupt

You just crushed a behavioral interview question.

Nice work.

Now here's where most people blow it:

They wait for the interviewer to ask "What would you do differently?"

Then they freeze.

The move? Answer it before they ask.

Shows reflection. Shows growth. Shows humility.

That's the difference between someone who did a thing and someone who learned from it.

---

## OPTION C: The Contrarian Take

Hot take: The "what would you do differently" question isn't a trap.

It's the easiest way to stand out.

Most people get defensive.
Most people fumble.
Most people clearly never thought about it.

You? You answer it before they even ask.

That's the move.

---

## OPTION D: The Short & Punchy (Maximum Engagement)

Interview tip that separates good from great:

Don't wait for "What would you do differently?"

Answer it before they ask.

Shows you're reflective.
Shows you improve.
Shows you're not delusional.

That's it. That's the tweet.

## WHY SINGLE TWEET > THREAD

1. **Algorithm favors engagement rate** — Threads dilute engagement across multiple posts
2. **Quote-tweets** — Single tweets get QT'd more (free amplification)
3. **Bookmark behavior** — People save single tweets, not threads
4. **Reply ratio** — Easier to reply to one tweet than navigate a thread
5. **Mobile UX** — 80% of X is mobile. Threads are annoying to read on mobile.

## OPTIMAL POSTING STRATEGY

**Best times to post (ET):**
- 8-9 AM (morning scroll)
- 12-1 PM (lunch break)
- 5-6 PM (commute/wind-down)

**Day of week:**
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday perform best for career content
- Avoid Friday afternoon and weekends

**Engagement bait (first 30 min is critical):**
- Reply to your own tweet with a follow-up thought
- Ask a question in the reply: "What's your go-to interview story?"

---

## SELF-REPLY TO ADD (Post 5-10 min after main tweet)

Replying to your own tweet:

"The three things this signals to an interviewer:

1. You're reflective (you don't just do stuff)
2. You actually improve (you have a plan)
3. You're humble (you know you're not perfect)

That's the kind of person teams want."

---

## HASHTAGS

Skip them. Hashtags on X look spammy and don't help discovery anymore. The algorithm surfaces content based on engagement, not hashtags.

---

## CTA OPTIONS (Pick One for the End)

- "What's your go-to behavioral interview story?"
- "Steal this."
- "Bookmark this before your next interview."
- No CTA at all (sometimes cleaner)

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION

Go with **Option D** (short & punchy) as your main tweet.

Then reply to yourself with the "three things" breakdown.

This creates a mini-thread without the downsides of a formal thread, and the self-reply bumps the original tweet in the algorithm.
