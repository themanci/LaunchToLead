**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

A client asked me during a coaching call:

"Does it get easier after school? Less stressful? Less hectic?"

They work almost full-time while in school full-time.

My honest answer: Yes.

Here's why 🧵

**Tweet 2:**

First, some context:

Juggling school + work takes an insane amount of:
- Hours
- Dedication
- Time management
- Mental energy

If you're doing this right now, you're doing one of the hardest things.

**Tweet 3:**

Reason 1: The uncertainty disappears.

Right now you're grinding with one question in the back of your head:

"Is this going to pay off?"

When you land that job—that question is answered.

You made it. The promised land is real.

**Tweet 4:**

Reason 2: No more juggling three lives.

School + work + personal life = constant context switching.

After graduation?

→ One primary focus
→ Evenings are yours
→ Weekends are yours
→ Mental space to breathe

The load drops significantly.

**Tweet 5:**

The stress peaks also flatten out.

School has massive spikes:
- Exams
- Finals
- Project deadlines
- All while working

Work stress exists—but it's more consistent.

Fewer extreme highs and lows.

**Tweet 6:**

Reason 3: Future stress becomes voluntary.

In school → Stress for a "potential" reward. Hope it pays off.

In your career → Stress for a "certain" reward. You know exactly what you're getting.

That shift changes everything.

**Tweet 7:**

Promotions, senior roles, management—yes, they bring more stress.

But you CHOOSE them.

You sign up knowing the trade-offs:
- More pay
- More responsibility  
- More influence

It's not a gamble. It's a decision.

The most important thing I told this client:

This too shall pass.

No state lasts forever.

Especially this one.

---

**Tweet 9:**

It's only a handful of years from your life.

And it WILL be over.

The key is to:

→ Keep seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
→ Hang in there
→ Know that you'll get what you set out to get

To every student grinding through school + work:

You're doing one of the hardest things.

The finish line is closer than you think.

Keep going.
