# X Post: Meeting Rules

---

**SINGLE POST VERSION (280 char max):**

4 things that fixed my meetings:

1. Send a clear agenda 24h ahead
2. Call on people—no silent spectators
3. Put away the laptops
4. End with "who's doing what by when"

None of this is hard. Doing it consistently is.

**THREAD VERSION:**

**Post 1:**
Meetings that go nowhere are a career tax.

Here's what actually helped me run better ones:

🧵

**Post 2:**
1. Send a clear agenda 24 hours ahead.

Not "let's discuss."

What's the goal? What decision? What info do we need?

**Post 3:**
2. Actually facilitate.

Call on people directly. "Sarah, what's your take?"

No more hiding in the corner while decisions happen without you.

**Post 4:**
3. Put away the laptops.

Context-switching kills 40% of your focus. If you can't be present, decline the meeting.

**Post 5:**
4. End with actions.

"Who's doing what by when?"

Follow up in writing. This alone cut my follow-up meetings in half.

**Post 6:**
Try one of these in your next meeting.

Which one are you starting with?
