**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

Want to instantly sound more organized in interviews?

Start your answer with a number.

"I took three key actions..."

Here's why this one change works so well: 🧵

**Tweet 2 (Why it works):**

When you say "three actions," the interviewer's brain relaxes.

They know what's coming.
They can follow along.
They stop wondering "where is this going?"

You just gave them a roadmap.

**Tweet 3 (The proof):**

It also proves you think in structure.

Hiring managers LOVE organized thinkers.

Starting with a number signals:
→ I don't ramble
→ I have a plan
→ I think clearly under pressure

**Tweet 4 (Before/After):**

❌ "So basically I started looking at the problem and talked to some people and eventually figured it out..."

✅ "I took three key actions. First, I analyzed root cause. Second, I aligned stakeholders. Third, I implemented the fix."

Same story. One sounds like a leader.

**Tweet 5 (Pro tip):**

Bonus: interviewers take notes.

When you say "three actions," they write:
• Action 1: ___
• Action 2: ___
• Action 3: ___

You just made their job easier.

They'll remember you for it.

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**

Try this in your next interview:

Before answering, pause and say:

"There were [NUMBER] key things I did..."

Then deliver each one clearly.

3 is the magic number. Enough depth without losing attention.
