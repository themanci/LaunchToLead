**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

A client said something that stopped me:

"It's like engineering school taught us how to be engineers, but not how to get a good job."

She's right. Here's the gap no one talks about 🧵

**Tweet 2:**

4 years of school taught you:

→ Thermodynamics
→ Data structures
→ Differential equations
→ How to survive brutal exams

But zero courses on resumes, networking, interviewing, or negotiating salary.

**Tweet 3:**

It's like learning to build a race car but never learning to drive it.

The skills that make you good at the job ≠ the skills that get you the job.

**Tweet 4:**

Then graduation comes and suddenly you're expected to:

• Craft a personal brand
• Navigate ATS systems
• Tell compelling stories
• Negotiate offers

...with zero formal training.

**Tweet 5:**

Most engineers figure this out the hard way—after months of rejected applications and ghosted interviews.

But here's the truth:

The job search is a skill. And like any skill, it can be learned.

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**

If you're feeling this gap right now:

You're not alone.
It's not your fault.
The system just never taught you this part.

The same brain that survived engineering school can crack this too.

Did your school prepare you for the job search? 👇
