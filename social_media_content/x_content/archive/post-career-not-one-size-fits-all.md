## OPTION 1: Single Tweet (Punchy)

Stop letting people tell you what you should want.

Big company ≠ slave
Small company ≠ dead end
Startup ≠ reckless
Own business ≠ crazy

Every path has trade-offs. None of them make you a "sucker."

## OPTION 3: Thread (Full Story)

**Tweet 1:**
Too many people are presenting their preferences as universal truths.

"Working corporate makes you a slave."
"Startups are just gambling."
"If you're not building your own thing, you're wasting your life."

This is projection, not wisdom.

🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The reality:

🏢 Big Company — Stability, clear roles, benefits
🏠 Small Company — Wear many hats, more visibility
🚀 Startup — 0 to 1 building, high impact
💡 Own Business — Full ownership, bring your vision to life

All valid. All have trade-offs.

**Tweet 3:**
Here's what nobody wants to admit:

Some people would HATE each of those options.

That's not a character flaw.
That's called being human.

**Tweet 4:**
You're not a sucker for working at a Fortune 500.
You're not a sellout for staying small.
You're not reckless for joining a startup.
You're not crazy for building your own thing.

You're making the decision that's right for YOU.

**Tweet 5:**

Listen to everyone.
Learn from everyone.
Then decide for yourself.

Career is not one size fits all.

Stop following. Start deciding.

## OPTION 4: Hot Take Tweet

Hot take: The people telling you that working for a company makes you a "sucker" are just projecting their own choices onto you.

Every path has pros and cons.
Pick the one that fits YOUR life.

Career is not one size fits all.
