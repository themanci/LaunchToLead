# X Thread: The "So What" Exercise

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
I was coaching someone last week with an offer on the table.

New company. Exciting role. Better opportunity.

But they couldn't pull the trigger.

Their mind was racing with "what ifs."

Here's the exercise that changed everything:

## Tweet 2 (The Fears)
The fears paralyzing them:

• "What if I get laid off in a year?"
• "What if the new company isn't stable?"
• "What if I regret leaving big company comfort?"

These weren't small concerns. They were monsters in their head.

But here's the problem...

## Tweet 3 (The Problem)
Most people stop at the "what if."

They let it hang there—this vague, looming, terrifying thing.

They never actually ANSWER the question.

Abstract fears = monsters.
Specific answers = manageable.

## Tweet 4 (The Exercise)
The "So What" Exercise:

1. Write down every "what if" haunting you
2. For each one, ask: "So what? Then what happens?"
3. Keep going: "And then what?"
4. Follow the chain to the very end

Don't stop until you reach the final conclusion.

## Tweet 5 (The Example)
Example:

"What if I get laid off in a year?"
→ So what? "I'd find another job."
→ Do you have savings? "Yes, 6-9 months."
→ So you won't be homeless? "No."
→ Could you go back to your old job? "Probably."

...So what's the actual catastrophe?

## Tweet 6 (CTA)
By the end you realize:

• You won't be homeless
• Your life won't end
• The worst case is survivable
• The fear was bigger than reality

The vague fear is ALWAYS scarier than the specific answer.

Write down your "what ifs." Answer them. See how small they are.
