# X Post: You Don't Have to Outrun the Bear

---

**SINGLE POST:**

You don't have to outrun the bear. You just have to outrun your slowest friend.

Same with the job market.

You don't need to be the best engineer on earth. You just need to put in more effort than the average applicant.

And right now? The average bar is low.

Outwork it.
