**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

Most candidates rush through their interview stories.

They speed through the Situation like it's boring.

Then wonder why their "amazing results" don't land.

Here's the fix: 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Insight):**

The bigger the monster you slay, the bigger the hero you become.

Your results are only as impressive as the problem they solved.

This is called "Painting the Pain."

**Tweet 3 (Before/After):**

❌ Weak: "We had a project running behind schedule..."

✅ Painted: 
→ "6 weeks behind on flagship launch"
→ "CEO reviewing progress daily"
→ "$200K/week in lost opportunity"
→ "2 team leads already quit"

Same story. 10x the impact.

**Tweet 4 (The Framework):**

3 ways to Paint the Pain:

1. Quantify stakes (revenue, users, timeline)
2. Show tension (who's watching, consequence of failure)
3. Create contrast (bigger problem = more impressive solution)

**Tweet 5 (The Math):**

Most people: 10% of story on Situation

Top performers: 40%

They let the interviewer *feel* the weight before revealing the solution.

That's what makes them memorable.

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**

Before you explain what you DID...

Make them understand why it MATTERED.

🐉 Slay bigger monsters. Become a bigger hero.
