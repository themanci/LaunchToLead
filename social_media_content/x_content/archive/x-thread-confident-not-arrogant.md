**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

A client asked me:

"How do I sell myself without sounding arrogant?"

Here's the balance that wins interviews 🧵

**Tweet 2:**

Confidence comes from knowing yourself:

→ Know your projects deeply
→ Know YOUR contribution (not "we delivered")
→ Practice until delivery feels natural
→ Believe you belong in that role

When you genuinely know your value, confidence shows up naturally.

**Tweet 3:**

Humility comes from honesty:

→ Give credit to teammates
→ Ask intelligent questions
→ Admit what you don't know
→ Share failures and what you learned
→ Talk about how you'd improve

Arrogant people don't do any of this.

**Tweet 4:**

The difference:

Arrogant → "I did everything"
Confident → "I led X while my teammate handled Y"

Arrogant → Never asks questions
Confident → Asks thoughtful questions

Arrogant → Avoids failures
Confident → Shares lessons learned

**Tweet 5:**

The key insight:

Confident people know their worth—AND their limits.

They own their wins.
They share their lessons.
They give credit where it's due.

The balance isn't a trick. It's authenticity.

**Tweet 6 (CTA):**

Practice telling your story out loud with honest feedback.

That's where real confidence is built.
