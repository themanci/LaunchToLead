# X Thread - Mitigate a Low GPA

## TWEET 1 (HOOK):

Your GPA is lower than you'd like.

Some companies have hard cutoffs—nothing changes that.

But many don't.

Here's how to mitigate it honestly:

## TWEET 2:

Tell the transition story.

The jump to college is brutal. Many students struggle early.

If you improved later, show it:

"My cumulative is 2.7, but my last two years averaged 3.4."

Same GPA. Completely different story.

## TWEET 3:

Use your core engineering GPA.

If your major GPA > overall GPA, use it.

Overall: 2.8 (gen eds dragged you down)
Engineering: 3.3 (what actually matters)

"Engineering GPA: 3.3/4.0" is 100% legitimate on your resume.

## TWEET 4:

Highlight specific wins.

Even with a low cumulative, you have bright spots:

→ A's in tough courses (Thermo, Controls)
→ High scores on capstone projects
→ Dean's List for specific semesters

These prove you can perform when it matters.

## TWEET 5:

Get in front of humans.

ATS filters automatically. Humans see potential.

→ Employee referrals bypass GPA filters
→ Career fairs = face-to-face impressions
→ LinkedIn outreach to engineers directly

A human can see your growth. A bot only sees the number.

## TWEET 6 (CTA):

The formula when they ask about your GPA:

1. Own it briefly
2. Show growth
3. Redirect to wins

Will this work every time? No.

But it works more often than you'd think.
