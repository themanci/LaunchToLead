# X Thread: Job Search Burnout

**1/**
The median job search takes 68 days.

If you're panicking at week 4, you're actually on pace.

Most people burn out because they don't know this. Here's what's really happening:

---

**2/**
Week 1-2: Optimism
"I'll find something fast."
You apply everywhere. Energy is high.

Week 3-6: Reality
Few responses. Panic creeps in.
You apply MORE, not smarter.

---

**3/**
Week 7-10: Desperation
You're applying to jobs you don't want.
Cover letters are generic.
Motivation is dying.

Week 11+: Burnout
Checking email 50x/day.
Doubting yourself.
Feeling broken.

---

**4/**
Here's what actually happened: You sprinted a marathon. Of course you're burned out.

The problem isn't you. It's your pace.

---

**5/**
The real culprits:

1) Spray-and-pray: 100 apps = 1-2 responses. Brutal ROI.

2) No visibility: Without tracking stages, anxiety loops forever.

3) Obsessive checking: Refreshing email ≠ progress.

4) Solo grinding: Every rejection feels personal.

---

**6/**
The fix isn't motivation. It's systems.

✅ Pick 10-15 target companies (not 100 generic ones)
✅ Build a spreadsheet: Company | Role | Stage | Next Action
✅ Time-box: 9-11 AM and 2-4 PM only. Then stop.
✅ Find an accountability buddy. Weekly check-ins.

**7/**
68 days is winnable.

But only if you treat it like a 10-week project, not a 10-day sprint.

Systems beat motivation.
Consistency beats intensity.
Community beats isolation.

---

**8/**
Start this week:
- Build your spreadsheet
- Pick 10-15 target companies
- Schedule your search hours
- Find an accountability partner

Your job is on the other side of week 10.

You just have to pace yourself.
