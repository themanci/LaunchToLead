# X Thread: Know Your Gaps Before You Get a Coach

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
A friend who coaches engineers at Amazon and Microsoft told me something:

"When I ask people what their biggest gaps are, I get silence."

They know they're stuck. They just can't say why.

If that's you, you're not at zero—you're in the negative.

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Coaching isn't magic.

A coach can't fix what you can't describe.

Show up saying "I'm stuck" without knowing why?

You'll waste sessions just figuring out the problem.

## Tweet 3 (The Fix)
Before you seek help, do the work:

→ What feedback keeps showing up in your reviews?
→ What do managers consistently tell you to improve?
→ What patterns follow you across jobs?

You already have the data. Use it.

## Tweet 4 (360 Feedback)
Do a quick 360°:

• Ask seniors: "What would you improve if you were me?"
• Ask peers: "What patterns do you notice in how I work?"
• Ask juniors: "How could I support you better?"

Different levels see different blind spots.

Know your gaps before you get a coach.

Know where you want to grow.
Know what's holding you back.

Then make the coaching count.
