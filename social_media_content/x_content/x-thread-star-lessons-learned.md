# X Thread - Master STAR Method Plus Lessons Learned

---

## THREAD TEXT:

**[Tweet 1]**
Most people teach you STAR for interviews.

Situation, Task, Action, Results.

But they stop at the wrong place. Right after Results, most candidates freeze when asked: "What would you do differently?"

That's where you're losing offers. 🧵

The problem: STAR is incomplete.

It tells what happened—but not whether you actually *learned* from it.

Arrogant people claim they did everything perfectly.
Confident engineers acknowledge what they'd improve.

Guess which one gets hired?

**[Tweet 3]**
Here's the fix:

Add an **L** to your STAR.

S = Situation
T = Task
A = Action
R = Results
**L = Lessons Learned** (or: What I'd Do Differently)

When you nail the L, you've just told the interviewer you're reflective, coachable, and growth-minded.

How to execute:

1. Write the full story (2-3 paragraphs, extreme detail)
2. Extract 5-7 bullets you can memorize
3. Practice until you deliver it naturally in 2 minutes
4. When they ask "what would you do differently?"—you're already prepared

The result?

You go from "good interview" to "let's hire them immediately."

That L is the difference between passing and winning.

Master it.
