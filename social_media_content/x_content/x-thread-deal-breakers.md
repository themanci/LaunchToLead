# X Thread: Don't Reveal Deal Breakers Before You Have an Offer

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
I keep seeing engineers kill their own leverage during interviews.

They bring up deal breakers before they even have an offer.

"I'm not sure I'd relocate."
"I really prefer remote."
"That salary might be too low."

Stop. Here's why this hurts you:

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Before you have an offer, you're competing.

Every concern you raise plants a seed:
• "This person has baggage"
• "The other candidate doesn't have these issues"
• "Why take the risk?"

You're giving them reasons to pass.

## Tweet 3 (The Kicker)
Here's what most people don't realize:

What you think is a deal breaker RIGHT NOW might not be once you're the top candidate.

Companies increase offers.
They negotiate remote policies.
They make relocation exceptions.

But only if they want YOU badly enough.

## Tweet 4 (The Strategy)
Before the offer:
→ Be agreeable
→ Be flexible
→ Be enthusiastic
→ Keep concerns to yourself

After the offer:
→ Now you negotiate
→ Now you're transparent
→ Now you discuss trade-offs
→ Now you have leverage

---

## Tweet 5 (CTA)
The offer is when the power shifts.

Don't give away your cards before you're even at the table.

Get the offer first. Then negotiate everything.
