# LinkedIn Post — "Schedule Your Priorities"

## Post Copy

"I want to do X, but I just don't have the time."

I used to say this all the time in college.

Update my resume? No time.
Start networking? No time.
Learn something outside of class? Definitely no time.

Then someone told me something that stuck with me:

Jeff Bezos has 24 hours in a day.
You and I have 24 hours in a day.

The difference is how you schedule those hours.

So I started doing something simple.

Every Sunday night, I sit down and ask myself:

"What do I actually want to accomplish this week?"

Then I open my calendar and I schedule it. Not a to-do list — my actual calendar.

Because a to-do list is a wish.
A calendar block is a commitment.

→ Want to update your resume? Block 45 minutes Tuesday night.
→ Want to reach out to someone in your field? Block 30 minutes Wednesday lunch.
→ Want to pick up a new skill? Block 1 hour Saturday morning.

Once it's on the calendar, you treat it like a class or a meeting. You show up.

This one habit changed everything for me.

It's not about having more time. It's about deciding what actually matters to you — and protecting that time.

So if you're in school right now, or you just graduated, try it this Sunday.

Sit down. Pick your priorities. Schedule them. And stick to it.

You'll be surprised how much you can get done when you stop wishing and start deciding.
