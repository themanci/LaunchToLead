# LinkedIn Post — "The Engineers Who Get Promoted Aren't the Smartest Ones"

## Post Copy

The engineers who get promoted aren't the smartest ones.

I know — that's hard to hear.

But after 6 years at John Deere (and reaching a level most people take 15+ years to hit), here's what I noticed:

The most technically brilliant people were often stuck.

Same role. Same level. Year after year.

And the people moving up?

They weren't writing the best code.
They weren't solving the hardest equations.
They weren't the ones with the most certifications.

They were the ones who could explain their impact to someone who doesn't speak engineering.

That's it.

Your director doesn't care that you "optimized the PID loop."

Your director cares that you:
→ Reduced downtime by 18%
→ Saved the plant $240K/year
→ Got the customer to renew a 3-year contract

Same work. Completely different language.

The gap between where you are and where you want to be isn't technical.

It's communication.

It's the ability to walk into a room with a VP and make them understand — in 60 seconds — why what you did matters to the business.

Most engineers never learn this.

Not in school.
Not in their first job.
Not even after 10 years.

Because nobody tells them it's the skill that matters most.

I'm telling you now.

If you want to move up:
• Stop collecting certifications. Start collecting stories.
• Stop describing tasks. Start describing impact.
• Stop talking to impress engineers. Start talking to move leaders.

Your work doesn't speak for itself.

You have to speak for it.

♻️ Repost if you know an engineer who needs to hear this.

## Scheduling Notes

- **Best time:** Evening post (7-9 PM CST)
- **Tone:** Slightly contrarian, experience-backed, broad appeal
- **Target audience:** Engineers at all levels, not just job seekers
- **CTA:** Repost (drives reach), comment bait is implicit (people will argue or agree)
