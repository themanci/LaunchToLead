# LinkedIn Video Script: The Say/Do Ratio

## Target Audience
Young / early-career engineers (interns, new grads, first full-time role)

## Runtime Target
60–90 seconds

## Format
Numbered list (5 rules) — high-retention format for LinkedIn video

---

## HOOK (first 3 seconds — look directly at camera, confident tone)

"There's one ratio that will make or break your engineering career — and nobody's talking about it."

---

## SETUP (10–15 seconds)

"It's called your Say/Do Ratio. And if you're coming into engineering fresh — whether it's your first internship or your first full-time role — this is the single fastest way to build a reputation… or destroy one."

"Your Say/Do Ratio is simple. It's the number of things you *do*… divided by the number of things you *say* you're going to do."

---

## TRANSITION INTO LIST

"Here are 5 rules to keep your Say/Do Ratio high as a new engineer."

---

## Rule 1: Under-promise. Over-deliver.

"When your manager asks if you can have something done by Friday — and you *think* you can — say Monday. Then deliver it Friday. You just went from 'met expectations' to 'exceeded expectations' without doing anything differently. You just managed the denominator."

---

## Rule 2: Stop volunteering for things that aren't priorities.

"New engineers love to raise their hand. I get it — you want to prove yourself. But every time you say 'I'll take that on,' you're adding to your denominator. If it's not a priority, and it's going to compete with something that *is* — don't say yes. Saying no to the wrong things is how you say yes to the right things."

---

## Rule 3: If you say it in a meeting, it's a promise.

"A lot of new engineers don't realize this. You casually say 'Oh yeah, I'll look into that' — and then forget about it. You forgot. Your manager didn't. Your team didn't. Every casual 'I'll handle it' that doesn't get handled chips away at your credibility. Treat every word out of your mouth in a meeting as a commitment."

---

## Rule 4: Track your commitments like you track your tasks.

"If it came out of your mouth, write it down. I don't care if it's a notebook, a Notion page, or a sticky note. The engineers who have a high Say/Do Ratio aren't just disciplined — they have a system. The ones who don't? They're constantly apologizing for things that slipped through the cracks."

---

## Rule 5: Protect the ratio at all costs.

"Here's the real talk. Your technical skills will develop over time. Everyone expects that. But your *reliability*? That reputation gets built in your first 90 days and follows you for years. A senior engineer who delivers 10 out of 10 things they commit to will always be trusted over the genius who delivers 6 out of 10. Talent gets you in the room. Your Say/Do Ratio keeps you there."

---

## CLOSE (look directly at camera)

"So if you're early in your engineering career, remember — it's not about saying more. It's about doing everything you say. Keep the ratio high."

---

## CTA (casual, after a beat)

"If this helped, share it with an engineer who needs to hear it. And follow me for more on building an engineering career that actually goes somewhere."

---

## LinkedIn Post Caption

## Production Notes

- **Runtime**: 60–90 seconds (LinkedIn sweet spot)
- **Delivery**: Slight pause between each rule (numbered-list retention hook — viewers stay for the next one)
- **Tone**: Conversational but direct — like talking to one person across a table
- **Aspect Ratio**: Vertical (9:16) or Square (1:1) — both outperform landscape on LinkedIn
