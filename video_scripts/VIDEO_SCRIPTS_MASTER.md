# 🎬 VIDEO 1: Homepage (index.html)

**Location:** Hero section  
**Goal:** Hook cold traffic, introduce the problem, tease the solution  
**Length:** 60 seconds

---

### HOOK (0-10s)
> "250 applications. Zero responses. Sound familiar?

> Here's what nobody tells you: Your resume looks exactly like everyone else's. And that's why you're invisible."

### PROBLEM + CREDIBILITY (10-30s)
> "I'm Mansour. 7 years at John Deere. Four promotions. I've hired engineers, interviewed engineers, and coached engineers into Fortune 100 companies.

> And I can tell you—the engineers who get hired don't have better degrees. They have a better system."

### SOLUTION (30-50s)
> "That's why I created The 21-Day Blueprint.

> Three 90-minute sessions. 52 proprietary frameworks. Your resume rebuilt. Your interview stories weaponized. A live mock interview with real feedback.

> In 21 days, you become a completely different candidate. Guaranteed."

### CTA (50-60s)
> "I only take 10 clients a month. Click below to book a free strategy call and see if you qualify."

# 🎬 VIDEO 2: Launch Page (launch.html)

**Location:** Hero right column  
**Goal:** Agitate the pain, show the cost of inaction  
**Length:** 60 seconds

---

### HOOK (0-10s)
> "Every month without a job costs you $6,000 to $8,000. Six months of searching? That's $40,000 gone.

> Let me show you why."

### PAIN AGITATION (10-30s)
> "You're using the same resume as 10,000 other applicants. Your interview answers sound generic. And the ATS filters you out before a human even sees your name.

> Meanwhile, your confidence is eroding. Your parents keep asking. The gap on your resume keeps growing."

### SOLUTION (30-50s)
> "The 21-Day Blueprint fixes all of this.

> Session 1: I transform your resume with The Impact Bullet Builder™.  
> Session 2: We build 15+ STAR stories that prove your value.  
> Session 3: Live mock interview so you're ready for the real thing.

> 52 methods. 40 bonus materials. Three 90-minute sessions. Done in 21 days."

### CTA (50-60s)
> "$1,997—or less than one month of the salary you're losing. Book your free strategy call below."

# 🎬 VIDEO 3: Packages Page (packages.html)

**Location:** Hero right column  
**Goal:** Stack the value, overcome objections  
**Length:** 60 seconds

---

### HOOK (0-10s)
> "Let me show you exactly what you get in The 21-Day Blueprint—and why it pays for itself before you even land the job."

### VALUE STACK (10-40s)
> "Three 90-minute 1-on-1 coaching sessions—4.5 hours of direct access to an engineer who's hired engineers.

> 52 proprietary methods—including The Impact Bullet Builder™, The Master Story Vault™, and The Competency Story Map™.

> 40 bonus materials—templates, scripts, checklists, and a First 90-Day Success Plan.

> Plus The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™: If we don't deliver a transformed resume, 15+ STAR examples, and a complete mock interview—I keep working with you for free until we do."

### OBJECTION BUSTER (40-50s)
> "This isn't a course you'll never finish. It's not group coaching where you're one of fifty.

> It's you and me. Working on YOUR resume. YOUR stories. YOUR interviews."

### CTA (50-60s)
> "$1,997. Three payments of $699. And only 10 spots per month. Book your strategy call now."

# 🎬 VIDEO 4: About Page (about.html)

**Location:** Hero left column  
**Goal:** Build trust, share origin story quickly  
**Length:** 60 seconds

---

### VULNERABLE HOOK (0-15s)
> "When I graduated with my engineering degree, I had no connections, no mentor, and no idea how to land a job.

> I watched classmates with worse grades get hired while I sent applications into the void."

### TURNING POINT (15-35s)
> "So I built a system. I learned how to quantify impact, tell compelling stories, and position myself as the obvious choice.

> I landed at John Deere. Four promotions in seven years. From mechanical engineer to software leader. And I started teaching other engineers the same frameworks."

### THE DIFFERENCE (35-50s)
> "I'm not HR. I'm not a recruiter. I'm an engineer who figured out the game—and I've packaged everything into The 21-Day Blueprint.

> 52 methods. Three 90-minute sessions. A complete transformation."

### CTA (50-60s)
> "If you're tired of feeling invisible, book a free strategy call. Let's see if I can help you too."
