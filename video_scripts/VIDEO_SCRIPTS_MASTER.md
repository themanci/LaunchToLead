## Hormozi Principles for All Videos

### Value Equation (Reference in Every Script)
$$\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Perceived Likelihood}}{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{Effort Required}}$$

### Core Messaging Pillars
1. **Pain-First** - Always lead with the problem
2. **Contrarian Truth** - Challenge the "spray and pray" advice
3. **Specificity** - Named methods, exact numbers, concrete results
4. **Credibility Stack** - Engineer, not recruiter. Hired engineers. 7 years at Deere.
5. **Risk Reversal** - The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™

### Voice & Tone
- Direct, no fluff
- "I'm going to be honest with you..."
- Numbers and specifics over vague promises
- Conversational, not salesy
- Slight urgency without desperation

# 🎬 VIDEO 1: Homepage Introduction (index.html)

## Context
- **Location:** Below hero CTA buttons, above mini stats row
- **Current Placeholder:** "Introduction Video Coming Soon"
- **Goal:** Hook cold traffic, introduce the problem, tease the solution
- **CTA:** Keep watching / Scroll down to learn more

## Script (60-90 seconds)

### HOOK (0-10 seconds)
**[Camera: Medium shot, direct eye contact]**

> "If you're an engineering student—or you just graduated—and you've sent out 50, 100, maybe even 250 applications... and you're getting nothing but silence?

> I need to tell you something nobody else will."

### PROBLEM AGITATION (10-30 seconds)
**[Camera: Slight lean in, more intense]**

> "The 'spray and pray' strategy everyone tells you to use? It's broken.

> Here's what they won't tell you: Hiring managers at Fortune 100 companies see THOUSANDS of applications for every entry-level role. If your resume looks like everyone else's... you ARE everyone else.

> And every month you don't land that job? You're losing $6,000 to $8,000 in salary. That's not frustration—that's a financial crisis."

### CREDIBILITY + CONTRARIAN TRUTH (30-50 seconds)
**[Camera: Pull back slightly, conversational]**

> "My name's Mansour. I spent 7 years at John Deere—going from entry-level mechanical engineer to software development leader. Four promotions. Four career pivots.

> But here's the thing: I wasn't the smartest person in the room. I just had a system.

> A system I've now taught to dozens of other engineers who've landed jobs at companies like Deere, General Motors, Lockheed Martin, and startups paying six figures.

> The same system that took me from 'invisible applicant' to 'must-interview candidate.'"

### SOLUTION TEASE (50-70 seconds)
**[Camera: Direct, confident]**

> "I call it The 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint.

> It's not a course. It's not group coaching. It's 3 one-on-one sessions where I literally rebuild your resume, weaponize your interview stories, and run you through a live mock interview.

> In 21 days, you become a completely different candidate.

> Guaranteed."

### CTA (70-90 seconds)
**[Camera: Lean in, personal]**

> "If you're tired of the application void... scroll down. 

> I'm going to show you exactly why your current approach isn't working—and the specific frameworks I use to fix it.

> Let's get you hired."

**[End with motion toward scroll or freeze frame with text overlay: "Keep Scrolling →"]**

# 🎬 VIDEO 2: Launch Path Sales Page (launch.html)

## Context
- **Location:** Hero section, right column next to CTA
- **Current Placeholder:** "Watch: Why 250 Applications Get You Nowhere"
- **Goal:** Agitate the pain HARD, position The Launch Blueprint as the obvious solution
- **CTA:** Book Strategy Session button directly below

## Script (90-120 seconds)

### HOOK (0-10 seconds)
**[Camera: Direct, slightly frustrated tone]**

> "Let me guess: You've done everything right.

> Good GPA. Engineering degree. Maybe an internship or two. 

> But when you apply for jobs? *Silence.*"

### THE 4 HORSEMEN OF PAIN (10-40 seconds)
**[Camera: Counting on fingers, each point more intense]**

> "Here's what's actually happening to you right now:

> **One:** You're losing money. Every month without a job is $6,000 to $8,000 you'll never get back. Six months of searching? That's $40,000+ in lost salary.

> **Two:** Your confidence is dying. Every rejection—or worse, every *ignored application*—chips away at you. You start wondering if your degree was even worth it.

> **Three:** Social pressure is crushing you. 'So... how's the job hunt?' from your parents, your friends, your relatives. You start avoiding people just to avoid that question.

> **Four:** The gap is growing. AI tools, automation, record numbers of graduates—the competition gets harder every single month you wait."

### THE REAL PROBLEM (40-60 seconds)
**[Camera: Shift to conspiratorial, "let me tell you the truth" tone]**

> "But here's what nobody tells you: The problem isn't you. The problem is your strategy.

> You're using the same resume template as 10,000 other applicants. You're describing your experiences the same way everyone else does. And your interview answers? Generic.

> I know because I've been on the other side. I've recruited engineers at John Deere. I've sat in hiring meetings. I've seen the pile of resumes that all look *exactly the same*.

> The engineers who get hired? They don't look like everyone else. They have a system."

### THE SOLUTION (60-90 seconds)
**[Camera: Confident, offering the solution]**

> "That's why I created The 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint.

> Three 60-minute sessions. Three weeks. And you come out the other side with:

> A resume built using The Impact Bullet Builder™—so your resume doesn't read like a task list, it reads like a results portfolio.

> A Competency Story Map with 15+ interview examples so polished, you'll handle ANY behavioral question thrown at you.

> And a live mock interview with real feedback—so you walk into the actual interview with confidence, not anxiety.

> $1,997. Or three payments of $699. And if we don't deliver on those three things? I'll keep working with you until we do. That's The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™."

### CTA (90-120 seconds)
**[Camera: Lean in, personal, direct]**

> "Look—I only work with 10 clients a month. Because this isn't some mass-produced course. This is me and you, one-on-one, fixing your career trajectory.

> If you're ready to stop being invisible... click the button below this video and book a free Strategy Session.

> Let's see if you're a fit. And if you are? Let's get you hired in 21 days."

# 🎬 VIDEO 3: Packages Overview (packages.html)

## Context
- **Location:** Hero section, right column
- **Current Placeholder:** "Watch: Why This Works" (2 min overview)
- **Goal:** Build massive perceived value, stack the offer, overcome objections
- **CTA:** Scroll to package details

## Script (2-3 minutes)

### HOOK (0-15 seconds)
**[Camera: Direct, presentation mode]**

> "Let me show you exactly what you get in The 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint—and why it's designed to make you interview-ready in just three weeks.

> This isn't theory. This is a system with 23 proprietary frameworks that I've used myself and taught to dozens of engineers."

### THE VALUE STACK (15-90 seconds)
**[Camera: Counting/listing, building excitement with each item]**

> "Here's what's included:

> **Session 1: The Invisible-to-Irresistible Resume Rebuild.**
> We take your current resume and transform it. I'll teach you The Impact Bullet Builder™—a 4-part formula that turns task-based bullets into results-based proof. We'll go through The Me-in-We Extractor™ to make sure YOUR achievements shine, not your team's. And The Universal Translator™ so your resume speaks the language hiring managers actually understand.

> By the end of Session 1? Your resume doesn't look like everyone else's.

> **Session 2: The High-Contrast Interview Weaponization.**
> This is where we build your interview arsenal. The Master Story Vault™—we document your best experiences in extreme detail. The Competency Story Map™—we map those stories to every competency interviewers care about. And The High-Impact Story Framework™—so when you tell a story, it LANDS.

> You'll leave with 15+ polished STAR examples. Enough to answer any question they throw at you.

> **Session 3: The Live Roast.**
> I put you through a real mock interview. I ask you the hard questions. I give you direct, specific feedback. No sugar-coating. We identify the weak spots and fix them—so when it's real, you're ready.

> On top of that? You get **23 bonus resources**. Templates, checklists, scripts, guides. Everything from follow-up email templates to negotiation scripts to a First 90-Day Success Plan."

### OBJECTION HANDLING (90-120 seconds)
**[Camera: Addressing the skeptic directly]**

> "Now, you might be thinking: 'Why should I pay $2,000 when there's free stuff on YouTube?'

> Here's the math: If you land a job even ONE month faster, that's $6,000 to $8,000 in your pocket. This pays for itself four times over.

> But more than that—YouTube gives you generic advice. I give you personalized coaching based on YOUR resume, YOUR experiences, YOUR target companies. We work on YOUR actual materials, together.

> And here's the guarantee: Complete all three sessions, do the homework, and you WILL walk away with a transformed resume, a completed story map, and real mock interview experience. If not? I keep working with you at no additional cost. Period."

### THE DIFFERENCE (120-150 seconds)
**[Camera: Contrasting approach]**

> "Let me tell you what this is NOT.

> This is NOT a 40-hour video course you'll never finish.
> This is NOT group coaching where you compete for attention.
> This is NOT generic advice that works for everyone—and therefore no one.

> This is three one-on-one sessions with an engineer who's hired engineers, coached engineers, and BEEN an engineer navigating this same system.

> 21 days. Three sessions. A completely different candidate on the other side."

### CTA (150-180 seconds)
**[Camera: Genuine, closing]**

> "Scroll down to see the full breakdown. The session details, the bonus list, everything.

> If this resonates with you—if you're tired of the application void, tired of feeling invisible—book a free Strategy Session.

> Let's talk about your situation and see if you're a fit.

> I only take 10 clients per month. Make sure you're one of them."

# 🎬 VIDEO 4: About / Meet Mansour (about.html)

## Context
- **Location:** Hero section, left column
- **Current Placeholder:** "Meet Mansour (3 min)"
- **Goal:** Build deep trust and likability, share origin story, establish credibility
- **CTA:** See The 21-Day Blueprint / Book Free Call

## Script (3-4 minutes)

### VULNERABLE HOOK (0-20 seconds)
**[Camera: Close, personal, reflective tone]**

> "I want to tell you something I don't usually share.

> When I was a senior in college, about to graduate with my mechanical engineering degree... I was terrified.

> I didn't have connections. I didn't have family in the industry. I didn't even have a stellar GPA. And I watched my classmates—some of them with worse grades than me—land jobs while I was still sending applications into the void."

### ORIGIN STORY - THE STRUGGLE (20-60 seconds)
**[Camera: Storytelling mode, emotional]**

> "I remember sitting in my apartment, applying to my 50th company, thinking: 'Did I waste four years and $40,000 on a degree that won't get me anywhere?'

> The worst part wasn't the rejections. It was the silence. Applying... waiting... hearing nothing. Over and over.

> I didn't come from money. I couldn't just 'wait it out.' I needed a job. And everything I was doing wasn't working."

### THE TURNING POINT (60-100 seconds)
**[Camera: Shift to determined, discovering something]**

> "So I did something different. I stopped following the conventional advice.

> Instead of applying to more companies, I studied FEWER companies—deeply. Instead of describing my experiences like everyone else, I learned how to quantify impact. Instead of hoping my resume would stand out, I engineered it to stand out.

> I created what I now call The Impact Bullet Builder™. I built a system for mapping my experiences to what companies actually look for. I practiced interview answers until they were second nature.

> And then? I landed at John Deere.

> Not because I was the smartest. Not because I had the best connections. Because I had a system."

### THE CAREER JOURNEY (100-140 seconds)
**[Camera: Proud but humble]**

> "Over the next seven years, I didn't just work at Deere. I thrived.

> Four promotions. Four major career pivots—from mechanical engineering to software development to leadership.

> And along the way, I started helping other engineers. Friends. Colleagues. Interns. People who were stuck where I had been stuck.

> I taught them the same frameworks. And they got results too. Jobs at Deere, GM, Lockheed Martin, startups paying six figures.

> That's when I realized: This isn't just my system. This is a system that works for engineers who don't have the advantages—but are willing to work smart."

### THE MISSION (140-180 seconds)
**[Camera: Direct, passionate]**

> "Here's what I want you to understand about me:

> I'm not a recruiter. Recruiters fill seats. I'm not HR. HR protects companies. I'm not a career coach who's never actually done the job.

> I'm an engineer. I got the degree. I landed the job. I've hired engineers. I've interviewed engineers. I've coached engineers.

> And now I've packaged everything I know into a 21-day program called The Launch Blueprint.

> My mission is simple: Help engineers who feel invisible become irresistible candidates. Not through tricks or gimmicks—through substance. Through a real system that actually works."

### WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT (180-210 seconds)
**[Camera: Conversational, one-on-one feeling]**

> "When you work with me, you're not getting generic advice. You're getting:

> One-on-one sessions where we work on YOUR resume, YOUR stories, YOUR interviews.

> Proprietary frameworks I've developed over 7 years of hiring and coaching.

> And real accountability—because I don't just hand you a course and say 'good luck.'

> We do this together."

### CTA (210-240 seconds)
**[Camera: Warm, inviting, personal]**

> "If any of this resonates with you—if you're frustrated, if you're stuck, if you're tired of feeling invisible...

> I'd love to talk with you.

> Click below to see The 21-Day Blueprint, or book a free Strategy Session where we can look at your specific situation.

> I've been where you are. And I know exactly how to get you out.

> Let's do this together."
