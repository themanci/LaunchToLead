250 applications and zero responses. Sound familiar? What nobody's telling you is that in a job market, when more and more people are competing for fewer and fewer positions, if your resume, if your application looks just like everybody else's, you're going to have the same results as everybody else. I'm Mansoor. 

After seven years and four promotions at John Deere, after hiring engineers, interviewing engineers, and coaching other engineers into Fortune 100 company positions, I can tell you one thing. Landing a great opportunity is not about having a better degree. It's about using a better system. 

That's why I created the 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint. Three 90-minute sessions, 52 of my own personal methods, your resume rebuilt from the ground up, your interview examples weaponized, and a full mock interview with detailed feedback from me. In 21 days, you will be a completely different candidate, guaranteed. 

I only take 10 clients a month. Click the link below to book a free strategy call and see if you qualify today.
