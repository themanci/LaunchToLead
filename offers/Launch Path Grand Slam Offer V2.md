# The 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint V2
## Alex Hormozi-Inspired Grand Slam Offer

---

## Final Offer Summary

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| **Package Name** | The 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint |
| **Price** | $1,997 |
| **Payment Plan** | 3 payments of $699 (one after each session) |
| **Scarcity** | Only accepting 10 new clients per month |
| **Pivot/Accelerate** | Coming Soon pages with waitlist signup |

---

## Strategic Focus

**Niche:** Right now I want to double down hard on the Launch path niche. I will keep the pivot and accelerate pages on my site as "Coming Soon" with waitlist signup, but marketing/advertising and grand slam offers will all be poured into Launch. Once this niche shows promise and return, I will add pivot first, then accelerate after.

---

## My Unique Branding

I am not an HR person, I am not a recruiter, I am not a contract head hunter, I am an engineer. I got an engineering degree and landed the job. I have hired people at John Deere as an engineer, not an HR person. I have interviewed people as an engineering manager. I have coached other engineering students, interns, and entry level employees as an engineer myself, as a staff engineer myself, as an engineering manager myself. This isn't HR and recruiter talk about how to be an engineer that stands out, this is coming from an engineer, a senior engineer, a staff engineer, an engineering manager. And it has worked for many that I have coached, and it will work for you.

## The Grand Slam Offer Framework

**Value Equation:**
$$\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Perceived Likelihood of Achievement}}{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{Effort \& Sacrifice}}$$

To create a "Grand Slam Offer" that makes prospects feel stupid saying no, we need to:
1. **MAXIMIZE** the Dream Outcome (what they get)
2. **MAXIMIZE** the Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (they believe they'll get it)
3. **MINIMIZE** the Time Delay (they get it fast)
4. **MINIMIZE** the Effort & Sacrifice (they don't have to do much)

---

## 1️⃣ Dream Outcome (MAXIMIZE)

> **The Dream Outcome Statement:**
> "Land a Top-Tier, High Salary Engineering Job without the imposter syndrome or the job application void."

### What Does "Top-Tier" Mean?
- Fortune 500 / Fortune 100 company
- $70,000 - $100,000+ starting salary
- Good benefits, growth potential, respected brand
- Role that matches their interests/skills

### What Does "Without Imposter Syndrome" Mean?
- Walk into interviews with confidence, not fear
- Know exactly what to say when asked any question
- Feel like you DESERVE the job, not like you're faking it

### What Does "Without the Job Application Void" Mean?
- Stop sending 250+ applications into the black hole
- Get responses, not silence
- Have a STRATEGY, not just hope

# 2️⃣ Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (MAXIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The more someone believes they will actually get the result, the more they'll pay.

### Why Prospects Should Believe They'll Succeed

**My Origin Story (Proof It Works for "Underdogs"):**
I didn't come from some ivy league school, I didn't have any mentors, I didn't have any coaches, I didn't have a stellar GPA, connections, or amazing internships, but I landed a job at John Deere because of the system and steps I am going to lay out for you in this coaching program.

**My Inside Knowledge (Proof I Know the Game):**
I have attended many recruiting events and have recruited for John Deere and will share with you my ocean of experience and what I have seen work well and not work well for candidates trying to get in from the outside.

**Client Results (Proof It Works for Others):**
I have also coached many engineering students and early career engineers and they have landed great jobs at Fortune 100 companies and at other top companies from the advice and systems that I taught them in our coaching sessions.

**The "You Can Too" Message:**
All this means that you can too. You don't need to have attended a top ivy league school, you don't need to have a 4.0 GPA, you just need to follow the system and advice that I will give you.

**The Urgency Amplifier:**
Also, in a market where job openings are more scarce, there is more competition, and you need a coach who has done it, more now than ever to help you beat the competition and land that amazing job offer.

### How We Maximize Perceived Likelihood:
1. **Testimonials** - Real clients who landed real jobs
2. **The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™** - De-risks the purchase entirely
3. **Your Engineer Background** - Not a "career coach," an actual engineer
4. **Specificity** - 52 proprietary frameworks sound proven and systematic
5. **Clear Process** - 3 sessions × 90 minutes, specific outcomes, no vague promises
6. **Complete Coverage** - We address the FULL journey, not just resumes
7. **40 Bonus Resources** - Comprehensive support materials

---

# 3️⃣ Time Delay (MINIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The faster someone can get the result, the more valuable it is.

### How We Deliver Results FAST

**Immediate Value (Before First Call):**
From the pre-session materials and prep work leading up to our first session, you will already start getting things in order. The job sourcing and networking bonus materials alone will transform how you approach the job search.

**Session 1 Transformation:**
After our first 90-minute coaching session, you will leave with a completely transformed resume and actionable systems you can put into practice immediately.

**Tangible, Not Theoretical:**
This isn't some hoodoo voodoo self confidence garbage, this is tangible actionable things that I will teach you and we will walk through together.

**21 Days, Not 6 Months:**
Give me 3 ninety-minute meetings and you will be a completely different candidate on the other side, guaranteed.

### Time Compression Techniques Used:
1. **Pre-Work Phase** - Client starts working 3 days BEFORE first call
2. **Aggressive Homework** - Apply to 50 jobs by day 21
3. **Actionable Frameworks** - Each session produces usable deliverables
4. **21-Day Timeline** - Compressed enough to feel urgent
5. **"Different Candidate" Promise** - Measurable transformation in 3 weeks

---

# 4️⃣ Effort & Sacrifice (MINIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The less effort/sacrifice required, the more valuable the offer.

### What We Ask of the Client

**Meaningful Commitment:**
There will be effort involved, but this is why you are hiring me. You need to attend the 3 ninety-minute sessions, and complete the homework assignments between sessions. This is aggressive by design—if you don't do the work, you can't blame the results on me.

**We Do the Heavy Lifting:**
In the sessions I will walk you through things in detail and give you specific examples and specific things we will do together live.

**Clear Requirements:**
The main effort and sacrifice you need to make is to attend the live 1:1s, complete the action items, apply to 50 jobs, and practice your stories daily.

### How We Minimize Effort & Sacrifice:
1. **Only 3 Sessions** - Not a 12-week bootcamp
2. **1:1 Live Coaching** - No self-paced modules to get lost in
3. **Done-With-You** - We work on their materials TOGETHER in session
4. **40 HTML Templates & Scripts** - They fill in blanks, not create from scratch
5. **Clear Action Items** - Know exactly what to do between sessions
6. **Structured Timeline** - 21 days keeps momentum high

### What They DON'T Have to Do:
- ❌ Watch 40 hours of course videos
- ❌ Figure out which module applies to them
- ❌ Wait for group coaching call times
- ❌ Do cold outreach to 100 people (Warm Intro is targeted)
- ❌ Change their personality
