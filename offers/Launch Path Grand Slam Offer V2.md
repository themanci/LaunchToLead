# The 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint V2
## Alex Hormozi-Inspired Grand Slam Offer

---

## Final Offer Summary

| Item | Decision |
|------|----------|
| **Package Name** | The 21-Day Engineering Career Launch Blueprint |
| **Price** | $1,997 |
| **Payment Plan** | 3 payments of $699 (one after each session) |
| **Scarcity** | Only accepting 10 new clients per month |
| **Pivot/Accelerate** | Coming Soon pages with waitlist signup |

---

## Strategic Focus

**Niche:** Right now I want to double down hard on the Launch path niche. I will keep the pivot and accelerate pages on my site as "Coming Soon" with waitlist signup, but marketing/advertising and grand slam offers will all be poured into Launch. Once this niche shows promise and return, I will add pivot first, then accelerate after.

---

## My Unique Branding

I am not an HR person, I am not a recruiter, I am not a contract head hunter, I am an engineer. I got an engineering degree and landed the job. I have hired people at Deere as an engineer, not an HR person. I have interviewed people as an engineering manager. I have coached other engineering students, interns, and entry level employees as an engineer myself, as a staff engineer myself, as an engineering manager myself. This isn't HR and recruiter talk about how to be an engineer that stands out, this is coming from an engineer, a senior engineer, a staff engineer, an engineering manager. And it has worked for many that I have coached, and it will work for you.

## The Grand Slam Offer Framework

**Value Equation:**
$$\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Perceived Likelihood of Achievement}}{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{Effort \& Sacrifice}}$$

To create a "Grand Slam Offer" that makes prospects feel stupid saying no, we need to:
1. **MAXIMIZE** the Dream Outcome (what they get)
2. **MAXIMIZE** the Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (they believe they'll get it)
3. **MINIMIZE** the Time Delay (they get it fast)
4. **MINIMIZE** the Effort & Sacrifice (they don't have to do much)

---

## 1️⃣ Dream Outcome (MAXIMIZE)

> **The Dream Outcome Statement:**
> "Land a Top-Tier, High Salary Engineering Job without the imposter syndrome or the job application void."

### What Does "Top-Tier" Mean?
- Fortune 500 / Fortune 100 company
- $70,000 - $100,000+ starting salary
- Good benefits, growth potential, respected brand
- Role that matches their interests/skills

### What Does "Without Imposter Syndrome" Mean?
- Walk into interviews with confidence, not fear
- Know exactly what to say when asked any question
- Feel like you DESERVE the job, not like you're faking it

### What Does "Without the Job Application Void" Mean?
- Stop sending 250+ applications into the black hole
- Get responses, not silence
- Have a STRATEGY, not just hope

# 2️⃣ Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (MAXIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The more someone believes they will actually get the result, the more they'll pay.

### Why Prospects Should Believe They'll Succeed

**My Origin Story (Proof It Works for "Underdogs"):**
I didn't come from some ivy league school, I didn't have any mentors, I didn't have any coaches, I didn't have a stellar GPA, connections, or amazing internships, but I landed a job at John Deere because of the system and steps I am going to lay out for you in this coaching program.

**My Inside Knowledge (Proof I Know the Game):**
I have attended many recruiting events and have recruited for John Deere and will share with you my ocean of experience and what I have seen work well and not work well for candidates trying to get into Deere from the outside.

**Client Results (Proof It Works for Others):**
I have also coached many engineering students and early career engineers and they have landed great jobs at Deere and at other top companies from the advice and systems that I taught them in our coaching sessions.

**The "You Can Too" Message:**
All this means that you can too. You don't need to have attended a top ivy league school, you don't need to have a 4.0 GPA, you just need to follow the system and advice that I will give you.

**The Urgency Amplifier:**
Also, in a market where job openings are more scarce, there is more competition, and you need a coach who has done it, more now than ever to help you beat the competition and land that amazing job offer.

### How We Maximize Perceived Likelihood:
1. **Testimonials** - Real clients who landed real jobs
2. **The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™** - De-risks the purchase entirely
3. **Your Engineer Background** - Not a "career coach," an actual engineer
4. **Specificity** - 52 proprietary frameworks sound proven and systematic
5. **Clear Process** - 3 sessions, specific outcomes, no vague promises
6. **Complete Coverage** - We address the FULL journey, not just resumes

---

# 3️⃣ Time Delay (MINIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The faster someone can get the result, the more valuable it is.

### How We Deliver Results FAST

**Immediate Value (Before First Call):**
From the prep work leading up to our first 15 minute discovery call you will already start getting things in order.

**Session 1 Transformation:**
After our first 1 hour coaching session, you will already have actionable things you will do and advice/systems that you can put into practice immediately.

**Tangible, Not Theoretical:**
This isn't some hoodoo voodoo self confidence garbage, this is tangible actionable things that I will teach you and we will walk through together.

**21 Days, Not 6 Months:**
Give me 3 one hour meetings and you will be a completely different candidate on the other side, guaranteed.

### Time Compression Techniques Used:
1. **Prep Work** - Client starts working BEFORE first call
2. **Homework Between Sessions** - Transformation happens between meetings
3. **Actionable Frameworks** - Each session produces usable deliverables
4. **21-Day Timeline** - Compressed enough to feel urgent
5. **"Different Candidate" Promise** - Measurable transformation in 3 weeks

---

# 4️⃣ Effort & Sacrifice (MINIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The less effort/sacrifice required, the more valuable the offer.

### What We Ask of the Client

**Minimal Commitment:**
There will be effort involved, but this is why you are hiring me. You just need to attend the 3 meetings, and do a little bit of homework before coming.

**We Do the Heavy Lifting:**
In the meetings I will walk you through things in detail and give you specific examples and specific things we will do together.

**Simple Requirements:**
The main effort and sacrifice you need to make is to attend the live 1:1s, do a little homework, and pay attention.

### How We Minimize Effort & Sacrifice:
1. **Only 3 Sessions** - Not a 12-week bootcamp
2. **1:1 Live Coaching** - No self-paced modules
3. **Done-With-You** - We work on their materials TOGETHER
4. **Templates & Scripts** - They fill in blanks, not create from scratch
5. **Bite-Sized Homework** - Small tasks between sessions
6. **31 Bonus Resources** - They don't have to create anything from scratch

### What They DON'T Have to Do:
- ❌ Watch 40 hours of course videos
- ❌ Figure out which module applies to them
- ❌ Wait for group coaching call times
- ❌ Do cold outreach to 100 people (Warm Intro is targeted)
- ❌ Change their personality
