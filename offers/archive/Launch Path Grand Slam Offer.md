## Strategic Focus

**Niche:** Right now I want to double down hard on the Launch path niche. I will keep the pivot and accelerate pages on my site as "Coming Soon" with waitlist signup, but marketing/advertising and grand slam offers will all be poured into Launch. Once this niche shows promise and return, I will add pivot first, then accelerate after.

## My Unique Branding

I am not an HR person, I am not a recruiter, I am not a contract head hunter, I am an engineer. I got an engineering degree and landed the job. I have hired people at a Fortune 100 Ag OEM as an engineer, not an HR person. I have interviewed people as an engineering manager. I have coached other engineering students, interns, and entry level employees as an engineer myself, as a staff engineer myself, as an engineering manager myself. This isn't HR and recruiter talk about how to be an engineer that stands out, this is coming from an engineer, a senior engineer, a staff engineer, an engineering manager. And it has worked for many that I have coached, and it will work for you.

## The Grand Slam Offer Framework

**Value Equation:**
$$\text{Value} = \frac{\text{Dream Outcome} \times \text{Perceived Likelihood of Achievement}}{\text{Time Delay} \times \text{Effort \& Sacrifice}}$$

To create a "Grand Slam Offer" that makes prospects feel stupid saying no, we need to:
1. **MAXIMIZE** the Dream Outcome (what they get)
2. **MAXIMIZE** the Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (they believe they'll get it)
3. **MINIMIZE** the Time Delay (they get it fast)
4. **MINIMIZE** the Effort & Sacrifice (they don't have to do much)

---

### The Problems

#### Resume Problems
- They need to get a resume together that is strong and stands out
- Knowing what experience to list on the resume is not clear
- Knowing how to demonstrate skills and competencies on the resume is not clear
- Knowing how to make the resume stand out in a pile of 1000 is not easy and trivial
- They might not have a lot of internships or experience on their resume and only be able to pull from coursework mostly
- They might not have had any extracurricular activities to put on the resume and this might really feel like their resume is weak
- Their GPA isn't extremely high and imposter syndrome is strong and they feel like they really can't be competitive
- Catering a resume to fit a job posting takes time and is painful to do for every single job posting they want to apply for
- Translating experiences into resume bullets that shine is difficult
- Writing out a resume that can be used to apply for jobs in a domain where they didn't necessarily study is difficult to translate

#### Application Strategy Problems
- They need to apply to companies strategically and not just apply to 1000 companies
- Figuring out which companies to apply to and which companies are good ones to work for is hard
- Figuring out which companies that they are top candidates for is difficult
- Coming up with talking points and questions to ask a recruiter or hiring interview panel about their company can be tricky, what to ask to make yourself look curious but not cross any weird boundaries or come off as awkward

#### Career Fair / Recruiting Event Problems
- They need to attend a career fair or a recruiting event to meet potential employers and discover new opportunities
- Finding the time with class and other commitments can be hard
- Getting the confidence to go talk to recruiters can be intimidating and hard
- Having a good elevator pitch prepared that captures a recruiters attention and makes them memorable is hard
- Knowing what to focus on and highlight in that short interaction is hard
- Knowing what questions to ask to stand out and seem genuinely like a good candidate is hard

#### Phone Screen Problems
- They need to pass a phone screen potentially as a first step
- Knowing what to focus and stress on in the phone interview is hard
- Being able to convey excitement and passion in a phone call can be very hard
- Being prepared for general fit questions can be hard for someone who is an engineer and ready for questions asking about technical projects they worked on
- Building some rapport and bantering in a "general fit" phone screen can be hard for less social people (which engineers tend to be)
- Knowing what questions to ask to understand if this company is even a good fit for them and them for the company is hard

#### Interview Problems
- They need to pass one or multiple in person rounds of interviews that are usually behavioral based
- Preparing for interviews is hard
- Figuring out which competencies this company is looking for is hard
- Preparing for a technical interview can be hard as well
- Finding quality practice partners to interview practice with is very hard
- Finding people who can give really valuable feedback in a mock interview is hard
- Carving out the time to document interview examples beforehand is time consuming and hard
- Sticking to a schedule and doing mock interviews well in advance of the interview is hard to hold oneself accountable to
- Performing well in an interview with a lot of pressure and things riding on it can be very stressful and hard
- Knowing how to conduct oneself in the interview can be hard
- Knowing what questions to come prepared with for the interviewers if there is time at the end of the interview can be very hard and tricky
- Knowing how to reach out and send a thank you and what to highlight in the thank you and include can be tricky and hard

#### Offer & Onboarding Problems
- They need to be able to negotiate a salary or benefits when an offer is made
- Assessing the quality of an offer can be hard
- Negotiating a salary/benefits as a young engineer can be hard, it can be easy to accept any first offer
- Knowing what to do in the first 90 days as a new engineer can be hard to make a good impression and hit the ground running to impress the new employer and manager

## 2️⃣ Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (MAXIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The more someone believes they will actually get the result, the more they'll pay. Social proof, guarantees, and positioning as "the expert" all increase perceived likelihood.

### Why Prospects Should Believe They'll Succeed

**My Origin Story (Proof It Works for "Underdogs"):**
I didn't come from some ivy league school, I didn't have any mentors, I didn't have any coaches, I didn't have a stellar GPA, connections, or amazing internships, but I landed a job at a Fortune 100 Ag OEM because of the system and steps I am going to lay out for you in this coaching program.

**My Inside Knowledge (Proof I Know the Game):**
I have attended many recruiting events and have recruited for a Fortune 100 Ag OEM and will share with you my ocean of experience and what I have seen work well and not work well for candidates trying to get in from the outside.

**Client Results (Proof It Works for Others):**
I have also coached many engineering students and early career engineers and they have landed great jobs at Fortune 100 companies and at other top companies from the advice and systems that I taught them in our coaching sessions.

**The "You Can Too" Message:**
All this means that you can too. You don't need to have attended a top ivy league school, you don't need to have a 4.0 GPA, you just need to follow the system and advice that I will give you.

**The Urgency Amplifier:**
Also, in a market where job openings are more scarce, there is more competition, and you need a coach who has done it, more now than ever to help you beat the competition and land that amazing job offer.

### How We Maximize Perceived Likelihood:
1. **Testimonials** - Real clients who landed real jobs (with names, companies, photos)
2. **The Launch Blueprint Guarantee™** - De-risks the purchase entirely
3. **Your Engineer Background** - You're not a "career coach," you're an actual engineer who recruits engineers
4. **Specificity** - Named methods (23 proprietary frameworks) sound proven and systematic
5. **Clear Process** - 3 sessions, specific outcomes, no vague promises

---

## 3️⃣ Time Delay (MINIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The faster someone can get the result, the more valuable it is. People will pay MORE for speed. A 21-day transformation beats a 6-month program.

### How We Deliver Results FAST

**Immediate Value (Before First Call):**
From the prep work leading up to our first 15 minute discovery call you will already start getting things in order to set yourself up to land that dream job.

**Session 1 Transformation:**
After our first 1 hour coaching session, you will already have actionable things you will do and advice/systems that you can put into practice immediately to up your game and be ahead of the crowd.

**Tangible, Not Theoretical:**
This isn't some hoodoo voodoo self confidence, imagine and materialize guru garbage, this is tangible actionable things that I will teach you and we will walk through together, concrete steps, no weird vague general intangible magic beans.

**21 Days, Not 6 Months:**
Give me 3 one hour meetings and you will be a completely different candidate on the other side, guaranteed.

### Time Compression Techniques Used:
1. **Prep Work** - Client starts working BEFORE first call
2. **Homework Between Sessions** - Transformation happens between meetings, not just during
3. **Actionable Frameworks** - Each session produces usable deliverables (not just "insights")
4. **21-Day Timeline** - Compressed enough to feel urgent, long enough to be believable
5. **"Different Candidate" Promise** - Measurable transformation in 3 weeks

---

## 4️⃣ Effort & Sacrifice (MINIMIZE)

> **Hormozi Principle:** The less effort/sacrifice required, the more valuable the offer. Do the hard work FOR them. Make it feel effortless to achieve the outcome.

### What We Ask of the Client

**Minimal Commitment:**
There will be effort involved, but this is why you are hiring me. You just need to attend the 3 meetings, and do a little bit of homework before coming.

**We Do the Heavy Lifting:**
In the meetings I will walk you through things in detail and give you specific examples and specific things we will do together or you will do outside of the meeting. But it won't be vague, and it won't be very complex.

**Simple Requirements:**
The main effort and sacrifice you need to make is to attend the live 1:1s, do a little homework, and pay attention.

**Massive ROI on Minimal Effort:**
Follow what I'm laying out for you and you will see massive returns on that effort.

### How We Minimize Effort & Sacrifice:
1. **Only 3 Sessions** - Not a 12-week bootcamp
2. **1:1 Live Coaching** - No self-paced modules to "find time for"
3. **Done-With-You** - We work on their materials TOGETHER in sessions
4. **Templates & Scripts** - They fill in blanks, not create from scratch
5. **Bite-Sized Homework** - Small tasks between sessions, not overwhelming assignments
6. **No Lifestyle Change Required** - No "wake up at 5am" or "network 2 hours/day" garbage

### What They DON'T Have to Do:
- ❌ Watch 40 hours of course videos
- ❌ Figure out which module applies to them
- ❌ Wait for group coaching call times
- ❌ Re-learn things they already know
- ❌ Do cold outreach to 100 people
- ❌ Change their personality or become "more extroverted"

## 5️⃣ Finding the Right Market

> **Hormozi Principle:** A Grand Slam Offer only works if you sell to the RIGHT market. The right market has 4 characteristics: Pain, Purchasing Power, Easy to Target, and Growing.

### Pain – They MUST Have It

> **Why Pain Matters:** People in pain will pay almost anything to make it stop. The more acute, daily, and emotional the pain, the easier the sale.

A lot of people in this market are in job search hell. Hundreds of applications and no job offer. Every month you don't land a job, you are losing $6-7k of pretax income missing out on that $80k a year dream job. You also have to keep hearing family/friends ask you "how the job hunt is going?" just being so demoralizing and taking the wind out of your sails, making social interaction with them awkward and you want to avoid it. You also start to doubt the value of your degree. Starting to feel like you wasted $40k plus for a degree, no doubt, with debt, is a heavy burden to carry. You start to feel like maybe college is worthless and you wasted a massive amount of time and money. What a terrible way to start out life entering the job market. Also, in the era of less jobs available, AI and automation squeezing the entry level job market, it's more important than ever to land a good job, and get your career going, before the gap widens as AI gets stronger and takes more jobs and makes the barrier to entry get higher and higher and higher.

**Pain Points (The 4 Horsemen):**
1. **Financial Pain** - Losing $6-7k/month of potential income
2. **Social Pain** - "How's the job hunt?" conversations with family
3. **Identity Pain** - Questioning if their degree was worth $40k+ of debt
4. **Existential Pain** - Fear that AI will make it even harder every month they wait

**Statistics:**
- 2025 engineering grad unemployment/underemployment rate ≈ 18–22% (NACE + NSF data)
- Average student sends 250+ applications for 3–5 interviews
- 73% report anxiety/depression tied to job search (2025 Handshake survey)
- Parents still paying rent for 40%+ of new grads
- → **Pain is existential.**

---

### Purchasing Power – They MUST Be Able to Pay

> **Why Purchasing Power Matters:** It doesn't matter how much pain someone has if they can't afford your solution. The right market has access to capital.

Parents have the ability to jump in and help here, terrified that their kids won't find a job and might have to move back in home or stay at home for extended periods and delay their career or keep decreasing likeliness to land a dream job in an oversaturated market with more people graduating new every semester. Students already have taken on massive debt to finish the degree, another 1.5-3k to get a huge payout of a 80k+ job is a small price to pay and a small amount to add to the heap. A lot of offers come with a signing bonus, which will be more than enough to cover the cost of coaching to land that job. This also doesn't just include college students and recent grads, could be people who just never got a great job in engineering and want to go from a crappy job to top tier dream fortune 100 company job.

**Who Pays:**
1. **Parents** - Terrified of kids moving back home, have disposable income
2. **Students** - Already in debt mode, what's another $2k for an $80k job?
3. **Signing Bonus Arbitrage** - $5k signing bonus pays for coaching 2x over
4. **Employed Engineers** - Making $60k, willing to invest to jump to $100k

**Statistics:**
- Average parental contribution to first-job coaching: $1,000–$3,000 (no questions asked if it guarantees a $90k+ salary)
- 68% of parents say they would pay for career help if it landed a job (2024 College Parent Survey)
- Price point ($1,997) is <1% of the first-year salary difference between "average grad" and "top 10% grad" ($72k vs $105k+)
- → **Parents see it as the cheapest insurance policy on earth.**

---

### Easy to Target – We MUST Be Able to Find Them

> **Why Targeting Matters:** The best offer in the world is worthless if you can't get it in front of the right people. The right market congregates in findable places.

A lot of good algorithm assistance and data to find. We can target on LinkedIn, Tiktok/Instagram, and physical locations. Targeting student engineering groups on university/college campuses will be valuable. Especially clubs that have serious driven students who are eager to land a dream job and their parents are willing to help them succeed and want them to succeed, think Robotics clubs, solar car clubs, mechatronics clubs, etc. Very driven people who really want to succeed at all costs.

**Where to Find Them:**
1. **LinkedIn** - Search "Mechanical Engineering Student" + "2025" or "2026" = thousands
2. **TikTok/Instagram** - #EngineeringStudent, #CareerTok, #ClassOf2025 = millions of views
3. **University Channels** - Subreddits, Discord servers, Slack groups
4. **Career Fairs** - Can literally buy attendee spreadsheets for $50
5. **Parent Facebook Groups** - "[University] Parents 2025" groups
6. **Physical Locations** - Robotics clubs, solar car teams, mechatronics clubs

**Statistics:**
- You can put your ad in front of 10,000 perfect prospects for <$200
- Engineering student communities are highly concentrated and engaged
- → **This market is EXTREMELY easy to target.**

---

### Growing – The Market MUST Be Expanding

> **Why Growth Matters:** A shrinking market means fighting over scraps. A growing market means rising tide lifts all boats. Pain is INCREASING in this market.

Engineering is not going away anytime soon. The demand for engineers is going up (AI tools make them more productive not obsolete yet). The pain of not getting hired is growing because there are so many engineers applying with "easy to apply" type of sites. People's resume gets lost in the noise and falls between the cracks. The pain is getting a lot worse because the market just keeps growing. Engineering programs don't teach soft skills well, which this program will help, and engineers are becoming more and more technical with new tools and new things like AI, so the gap is widening for the benefit of this kind of service.

**Why the Market Is GROWING:**
1. **Supply Increasing** - Record number of engineering graduates 2025-2027
2. **Demand Flat** - Hiring freeze recovery is slow, fewer entry-level roles
3. **Pain Starting Earlier** - AI anxiety making students panic freshman year
4. **Stakes Getting Higher** - Tuition hits $80k+/year, parents panicking
5. **Soft Skills Gap Widening** - Engineering programs focused on technical, not interview skills

**Statistics:**
- Record number of engineering graduates in 2025–2027
- Hiring freeze recovery is slow → fewer entry-level roles
- AI anxiety making students panic earlier (freshman year now)
- Parental pressure skyrocketing as tuition hits $80k+/year
- → **The market is expanding 15–20% YoY in desperation.**
