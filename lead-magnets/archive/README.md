## 📊 Distribution Strategy

### **How to Use These Files:**

1. **Open in browser** → Right-click → "Print" → "Save as PDF"
2. **Each HTML file becomes a standalone PDF** for email distribution
3. **Extract individual pages** if you want to distribute concepts separately
4. **Embed on website** as downloadable resources with email capture forms

### **Email Capture Integration:**

Create a `/free-resources` page with:
- Preview images of each lead magnet
- Email capture form per resource
- Automatic PDF delivery via email automation

### **Suggested Groupings:**

- **Starter Pack:** Impact Equation + Universal Translator + 5-Star Story Filter
- **Pivot Bundle:** Trojan Horse + 10% Margin Calculator
- **Interview Bundle:** 5-Star Story Filter + Boring to Booming Examples
- **Resume Bundle:** Impact Equation + Universal Translator + Resume Red Flags (when created)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review existing 6 lead magnets** - Open each HTML in browser, test print/PDF export
2. **Choose priority for remaining 8** - Which will have highest ROI?
3. **Set up email capture page** - Create `/free-resources.html` with forms
4. **Integrate with email platform** - ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or similar for automation
