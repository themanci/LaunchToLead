## The 10 New Ideas

---

### 1. 🎯 The STAR+2 Story Vault Builder
**Path:** Launch (Universal crossover)
**Format:** Interactive worksheet + example bank (8-10 pages)
**The Hook:** "The interview framework that got me hired at John Deere — and it's not just STAR."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Most people know STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result). We teach STAR + 2 bonus dimensions that 99% of candidates skip:
- **+1: "What was your biggest lesson learned or takeaway?"** — Shows growth mindset. Interviewers *love* this because it proves you don't just do things, you *learn* from them.
- **+2: "If you could go back and do it again, what would you do differently?"** — Shows self-awareness and maturity. This is the answer that makes interviewers lean forward.

**Proposed Pages:**
1. Cover — "The STAR+2 Story Vault: The Interview Framework Top Candidates Use"
2. Why STAR Alone Isn't Enough — the 2 missing pieces that separate good from unforgettable
3. The STAR+2 Framework Explained — with a real engineering example (before/after)
4. The 10 Most Common Behavioral Questions — mapped to which STAR+2 stories to use
5. Story Mining Worksheet — guided prompts to pull stories from internships, projects, and school
6. The Story Vault Template — a fillable bank of 5 pre-formatted STAR+2 stories
7. "Weak Story → Strong Story" Transformations — 3 real before/after rewrites
8. The 60-Second Drill — timed practice method to nail delivery
9. Cheat Sheet — one-page pocket reference for interview day
10. CTA — "Want us to review your Story Vault? Book a free call."

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
This gives them an actual *system* with fillable templates. Most coaching charges $200+ for this kind of framework. We're giving them the scaffolding AND examples.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** This was Mansour's original idea. The "+2" additions are genuine proprietary IP — no one else teaches this specific framework publicly.

---

### 2. 📊 The Job Search Command Center (Google Sheets Template)
**Path:** Launch
**Format:** Pre-built Google Sheets template + 4-page setup guide (download link)
**The Hook:** "The exact spreadsheet my clients use to land jobs in 45 days."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
This isn't a guide — it's a *ready-to-use tool*. Based directly on The Application Pipeline™ from the Launch Method V3:
- Pre-built pipeline stages (Prospect → Networked → Applied → Screening → Interviewing → Offer → Archived)
- Conditional formatting (rows turn red when follow-ups are overdue)
- Metrics dashboard (response rate, days-to-offer, conversion by job board tier)
- Built-in follow-up cadence reminders (Day 7, 14, 21, 28 — auto-calculated)
- Job Board Tier column tied to the 10-tier ROTI hierarchy

**Proposed Deliverable:**
- Google Sheets template (shareable link, "Make a Copy")
- 4-page PDF setup guide:
  1. How to set up your copy
  2. The 7 pipeline stages explained
  3. Metrics that matter (what to track weekly)
  4. The Sunday Review Ritual (15-min weekly check-in)

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
People *love* templates. This is a fully functional CRM for their career — the kind of thing career coaches charge $50-100 for as a digital product. The setup guide makes it usable immediately.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** Could tie into a "Job Search Command Center Masterclass" upsell. The template is the free hook, the coaching shows them how to interpret the data.

---

### 3. 📝 The Networking Script Playbook
**Path:** Launch (Universal crossover)
**Format:** Copy-paste script collection (8-10 pages)
**The Hook:** "15 word-for-word scripts to network without feeling like a used car salesman."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Students don't network because they don't know *what to say*. This removes that friction entirely. Every script is copy-paste ready with [brackets] for personalization:

**Scripts included:**
1. LinkedIn connection request to alumni
2. LinkedIn connection request to hiring manager
3. Informational interview request (email)
4. Informational interview — the 5 questions to ask
5. Post-informational interview thank you + relationship bridge
6. The "Soft Referral Ask" (after 2+ touchpoints)
7. The "Direct Referral Ask" (when they offer)
8. Cold DM to recruiter on LinkedIn
9. Career fair follow-up email
10. "I just applied" heads-up to internal contact
11. Interview thank you (within 24 hours)
12. Post-rejection graceful response (keeps door open)
13. The "Keep in Touch" quarterly check-in
14. The "I got the job" thank you (relationship investment)
15. The "I saw your post" engagement starter (warm-up)

**Proposed Pages:**
1. Cover — "The Networking Script Playbook for Engineers"
2. The Golden Rule — Value Before Ask (the philosophy in 1 page)
3-8. The 15 scripts (organized by scenario, 2-3 per page)
9. Timing Guide — when to send each script
10. CTA — "Want personalized networking coaching?"

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
This is the most *immediately actionable* lead magnet possible. Someone downloads it, copies a script, sends it, gets a response. Instant proof that our methods work. It's a gateway drug to full coaching.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** High viral potential — people share script templates. Each script reinforces the Warm Intro Protocol™ and Sniper Approach from Launch Method V3.

---

### 4. 🗺️ The Engineering Career Path Atlas
**Path:** Universal (Launch / Pivot / Accelerate)
**Format:** Visual career map + role profiles (10-12 pages)
**The Hook:** "The 25 engineering career paths your professors never told you about."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Students think "engineer" means one thing. They don't know about the 25+ roles that exist. Mansour's own journey (engineer → scrum master → product owner → engineering manager → staff engineer → software development enablement leader) proves the breadth is real.

**Proposed Pages:**
1. Cover — "The Engineering Career Path Atlas: 25 Roles You Didn't Know Existed"
2. The Career Map (visual flowchart) — 5 career lanes:
   - Technical IC Track (engineer → senior → staff → principal → fellow)
   - Management Track (tech lead → EM → director → VP Engineering)
   - Product Track (engineer → TPM → PM → Group PM → VP Product)
   - Business Track (engineer → solutions architect → pre-sales → consulting)
   - Adjacent Track (engineer → scrum master → coach → enablement)
3-7. Each lane gets a full page with: role titles, salary ranges (2025 data), skills needed, typical timeline, "how to get there" summary
8. The "Which Path Fits Me?" Quick Quiz (10 questions)
9. Mansour's 6-Role Journey — the real story (builds trust + proves it's possible)
10. The "2-Year Experiment" Framework — how to test a path without committing
11. Skill Overlap Matrix — shows which skills transfer between paths (reduces fear of pivoting)
12. CTA — "Not sure which path? Let's map yours together."

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
This is *life-changing context* that most people don't get until 5+ years into their career. Giving it to students early is like handing them a cheat code. The visual map alone is worth sharing.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** Extremely high share potential. Students will send this to classmates. Each career lane maps to a coaching path (Launch for entry, Pivot for lane changes, Accelerate for promotions within a lane).

---

### 5. ⏱️ The Application Timing Cheat Sheet
**Path:** Launch
**Format:** One-page visual reference + 2-page explainer (3 pages total)
**The Hook:** "When you apply matters more than what you apply with. Here's the exact schedule."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Based directly on The Application Timing Strategy™ and "God Mode" Window from Launch Method V3. This compresses hours of strategy into a single printable reference:

**The Cheat Sheet Includes:**
- **The Posting Lifecycle:** Green Zone (Day 0-2), Yellow Zone (Day 3-7), Dead Zone (Day 14+)
- **The God Mode Window:** Tue/Wed/Thu, 6-10 AM (hiring manager's timezone)
- **The Seasonal Calendar:** Q1 Golden Window, Q2 Cleanup, Q3 Summer Lull, Q4 Fall Rush
- **Discipline-Specific Timing:** Peak hiring periods for MechE, EE, SWE, Civil
- **The 24-Hour Rule:** Only apply to jobs posted within 48 hours
- **Red Flags to Skip:** 500+ applicants, 30+ day old posts, vague JDs

**Proposed Pages:**
1. The One-Page Cheat Sheet (visual, color-coded, print-ready, fridge-worthy)
2. The Math Behind It — why timing beats perfection (data + client examples)
3. CTA — "Want the full Application Timing Strategy? Let's talk."

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
It's *immediately useful*. Print it, stick it on the wall, follow it. The simplicity is the value — one page that changes behavior instantly. And the data behind it (3x interview rates for early apps, 20-30% more views in God Mode window) is compelling.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** This is the "quick win" lead magnet — low page count, high immediate value. Great for top-of-funnel (low commitment to download). The cheat sheet format is highly shareable on social media.

### 6. 💰 The New Grad Salary Negotiation Toolkit
**Path:** Launch
**Format:** Calculator + scripts + guide (8 pages)
**The Hook:** "New grads leave $5,000-$15,000 on the table because no one taught them to negotiate."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Most new grads accept the first offer because they're terrified of losing it. This toolkit gives them the confidence AND the words:

**Proposed Pages:**
1. Cover — "The New Grad Salary Negotiation Toolkit"
2. The Negotiation Mindset — why companies *expect* you to negotiate (the "Budget Buffer" reality)
3. The Total Compensation Decoder — salary is only 60% of the package. Breakdown:
   - Base salary, signing bonus, relocation, RSUs/equity, 401k match, PTO, WFH stipend
   - How to calculate the *real* value of an offer
4. The Market Data Cheat Sheet — salary ranges by discipline, experience level, and location (2025 data from Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, BLS)
5. The Negotiation Script (The "Enthusiastic Counter"):
   - "I'm thrilled about this opportunity. Based on my research and the value I'll bring, I was hoping for [X]. Is there flexibility?"
   - Variations for: base salary, signing bonus, start date, remote flexibility
6. The Counter-Offer Email Template — word-for-word email for written negotiations
7. The "What If They Say No?" Decision Tree — how to handle pushback gracefully
8. The Offer Comparison Matrix — side-by-side template for evaluating multiple offers
9. CTA — "Want us to review your offer and negotiate together?"

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
This directly puts money in their pocket. A $5K salary increase compounded over a 40-year career is worth $500K+. Giving away the scripts and calculator builds massive trust and goodwill.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** This has a natural urgency trigger — people download it when they have an offer in hand. Perfect for bottom-of-funnel (they're already close to a decision). Could also work as a Pivot path magnet for career changers negotiating.

---

### 7. 🏢 The New Grad Company Hit List (100+ Companies)
**Path:** Launch
**Format:** Searchable/filterable PDF or spreadsheet (6-8 pages)
**The Hook:** "100+ companies that actually hire new grads — organized by discipline, sorted by your odds."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Based on The New Grad Friendly Company List™ from Launch V3. Students waste months applying to the wrong companies. This gives them a curated, research-backed target list:

**Proposed Structure:**
1. Cover — "The Engineering New Grad Hit List: 100+ Companies That Actually Want You"
2. How to Use This List — The Portfolio Approach (3 Whales, 3 Shields, 3 Training Grounds, 3 Builders, 3 Innovators)
3-7. Company Profiles by Category:
   - **🐋 Whales** (20 companies) — Big Tech, high pay, extreme competition
   - **🛡️ Shields** (20 companies) — Defense, stability, clearance paths
   - **🎓 Training Grounds** (20 companies) — Rotational programs, best for first job
   - **🏗️ Builders** (20 companies) — Industrials, low competition, hands-on
   - **🚀 Innovators** (20 companies) — Startups, equity upside, fast growth
   Each entry includes: company name, new-grad-friendly rating (1-5), disciplines hired, avg salary range, application link
8. The Supplier Hack — how to find 50 more companies no one knows about
9. The "Green Flag / Red Flag" Checklist — how to vet any company
10. CTA — "Want a personalized target list for your discipline? Book a call."

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
This saves *weeks* of research. It's the kind of thing someone would pay $30 for on Gumroad. The categorization (Whales/Shields/etc.) makes it feel strategic, not just a list. And the Supplier Hack at the end is a golden nugget that shows we think differently.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** High download potential — the title alone ("100+ Companies") creates massive curiosity. Could be updated annually with fresh data. Pairs perfectly with the Job Search Command Center template (idea #2).

---

### 8. 🔍 The LinkedIn Profile Audit for Engineers
**Path:** Universal (Launch / Pivot / Accelerate)
**Format:** Self-assessment checklist + optimization guide (6-8 pages)
**The Hook:** "87% of recruiters check LinkedIn before calling you. Here's exactly what they're looking for."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Engineers either have no LinkedIn presence or a terrible one. This audit gives them a section-by-section teardown:

**Proposed Pages:**
1. Cover — "The Engineer's LinkedIn Profile Audit"
2. The Recruiter's Eye — what recruiters actually look at (in order): headline, about section, experience, skills, activity. Time spent: 7.4 seconds on average.
3. The Headline Formula — "[Role] | [Specialty] | [Value Proposition]" with 10 engineer-specific examples
4. The About Section Blueprint — the 4-paragraph formula:
   - Para 1: Hook (your unique angle)
   - Para 2: Proof (metrics and accomplishments)
   - Para 3: Skills (keyword-rich for search)
   - Para 4: CTA (what you want — job, connection, etc.)
5. The Experience Section — applying the Impact Equation to every bullet (ties to existing lead magnet!)
6. The Skills & Endorsements Strategy — the top 20 keywords by discipline that recruiters search for
7. The Activity Score — why posting/commenting 2x per week increases profile views by 5x
8. The 30-Point Audit Checklist — score your profile, identify gaps
9. Before/After Profile Teardown — real examples (anonymized)
10. CTA — "Want a professional LinkedIn review? Let's optimize yours."

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
LinkedIn is *the* platform for engineering jobs. This guide is immediately actionable — someone can audit and fix their profile in one sitting. The checklist format creates a gamified experience (score yourself, beat your number).

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** This cross-sells naturally with Impact Equation (for experience bullets) and STAR+2 Story Vault (for interview prep after recruiters reach out). Creates a natural funnel: LinkedIn audit → Impact Equation → STAR+2 → coaching.

---

### 9. 🧪 The "First 90 Days" New Job Playbook
**Path:** Accelerate (with Launch crossover — post-hire)
**Format:** Day-by-day action plan (8-10 pages)
**The Hook:** "What you do in your first 90 days determines the next 3 years of your career."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
Everyone focuses on *getting* the job. No one teaches what to do *after* you start. This is the gap. Mansour's experience across 6 roles means he knows exactly what separates people who get promoted in 18 months from those stuck for 3+ years.

**Proposed Pages:**
1. Cover — "The First 90 Days Playbook: How to Set Up Your Next Promotion Before Your Badge Photo Dries"
2. The 90-Day Thesis — your first 90 days are an audition for your next role
3. **Days 1-30: "The Sponge Phase"**
   - Learn the team's unwritten rules (who has real influence vs. title influence)
   - Map the stakeholder landscape (who to impress, who to help, who to avoid)
   - Ask the "Golden Question" to your manager: "What does success look like at 30/60/90 days?"
   - The 1:1 setup guide — how to structure your first manager meeting
4. **Days 31-60: "The Builder Phase"**
   - Ship one small win that's visible to the team (not just your manager)
   - Start the "Meeting After the Meeting" habit (build relationships with senior ICs)
   - Volunteer for one cross-functional initiative (visibility multiplier)
   - Begin documenting your wins (future promotion evidence)
5. **Days 61-90: "The Strategist Phase"**
   - Have the "Where Am I?" conversation with your manager (calibration check)
   - Identify one process or tool that could be improved and propose a solution
   - Build a relationship with someone one level above your manager (skip-level visibility)
   - Create your 6-month development plan
6. The 90-Day Checklist — every action item on one page
7. The "Career Capital" Tracker — template to log wins, skills gained, relationships built
8. Common First-90-Day Mistakes (and how to avoid them):
   - Trying to change everything immediately
   - Staying invisible and "just doing the work"
   - Not asking for feedback until review time
   - Ignoring the social/political landscape
9. CTA — "Ready to accelerate your career? The Accelerate Path coaching dives deep."

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
This fills a *massive* gap in the market. Career coaching stops at "get the job." We keep going. This positions Mansour as the coach who cares about your *career*, not just your *job search*. Also captures a new audience: people who already have jobs but want to grow.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** This is a natural bridge from Launch (job search) to Accelerate (promotion) coaching. Perfect for clients who landed through our coaching — extends the relationship. Also attracts organic traffic from people who aren't job searching yet.

---

### 10. 🎙️ The Behavioral Interview Question Bank (50 Questions + STAR+2 Starters)
**Path:** Launch (Universal crossover)
**Format:** Question bank with framework starters (8-10 pages)
**The Hook:** "50 real behavioral interview questions from FAANG, defense, and Fortune 500 — with a framework to answer every single one."

**What Makes It Insanely Valuable:**
This pairs with the STAR+2 Story Vault (idea #1) but goes wider. Instead of building stories, this is about *anticipating* what you'll be asked and having a plan:

**Proposed Pages:**
1. Cover — "The Behavioral Interview Question Bank: 50 Questions You WILL Be Asked"
2. How Behavioral Interviews Work — the interviewer's scoring rubric explained
3. **Category 1: Leadership & Influence** (10 questions)
   - "Tell me about a time you led a team through a difficult project"
   - "Describe a situation where you had to influence someone without authority"
   - Each question includes: why they ask it + which STAR+2 elements to emphasize
4. **Category 2: Problem Solving & Technical Judgment** (10 questions)
5. **Category 3: Teamwork & Conflict** (10 questions)
6. **Category 4: Failure & Growth** (10 questions)
7. **Category 5: Initiative & Drive** (10 questions)
8. The "Story Mapping Matrix" — map your best 5 STAR+2 stories to cover all 50 questions (most stories answer 3-5 questions each)
9. The 3-Minute Rule — how to keep answers concise (setup: 30 sec, action: 90 sec, result + lessons: 60 sec)
10. CTA — "Want to practice with a coach who's been on both sides of the interview table?"

**Why It's "Can't Believe It's Free":**
50 real questions with strategic guidance on how to answer them. People would pay $20-40 for this on a career prep site. The Story Mapping Matrix alone is worth the download — it shows you don't need 50 different stories, just 5 great ones positioned correctly.

**Status:** 💡 Brainstorm
**Notes:** Creates a 1-2-3 funnel with other interview lead magnets: (1) STAR+2 Story Vault builds the stories → (2) Question Bank shows where to deploy them → (3) Power Pause Framework (backlog) manages the anxiety. Could bundle all three as a "Interview Mastery Starter Kit."

## Notes & Open Questions

- [ ] Should we bundle #1 + #10 as an "Interview Mastery Starter Kit"?
- [ ] Should #2 (Command Center) be a Google Sheets template with a setup video instead of PDF?
- [ ] Should #7 (Company Hit List) include a Google Sheets version that's searchable/filterable?
- [ ] Could #4 (Career Path Atlas) become a flagship "signature" lead magnet that's bigger/better than anything else in the market?
- [ ] What disciplines should we prioritize first? (SWE, MechE, EE seem highest demand)
- [ ] Should each lead magnet have a companion TikTok/LinkedIn post driving traffic to it?
