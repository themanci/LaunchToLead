Stop Applying Into the Void:

Here is the exact roadmap and detailed steps that I took to land my first role at a Fortune 100 company

First, your resume will find its way into the trash can if it doesn’t capture a recruiter or hiring manager’s attention quickly.  Most managers or recruiters (especially recruiters) are looking at so many resumes, and have seen so many resumes, that typically within 20 seconds of skimming a resume they can tell if this is something they should spend more time on or not.  Obvious errors here or blunders can make it easy to get your resume passed on in 20 seconds or less.

First thing I did was completely overhaul my resume.  I initially had a resume that was more “job description” type bullets.  And this is very common. This impresses no one.  Listing things that were your “duties” or "responsibilities" or “tasks” that you had to do as part of your job is not going to wow anyone.  This shows that either you didn’t want to put the effort in to write bullet points that are actual accomplishment, or it shows that you don’t have any real accomplishments to list. Either of which is bad news for your chances of impressing a potential employer.

I recrafted my resume from top to bottom, with most relevant experiences on top and least relevant on bottom. This doesn’t necessarily need to be in “recency” order, think more “relevance.”  Some people have things listed on their resume that might be relevant for one job application, but not another.  I made sure my experiences, and bullets were crafted to be relevant to the current role I was applying for at this company.

A big challenge I had here was that my only professional experience working as an engineer at the time came in the form of 1 year at the Iowa Department of Transportation as a Highway Design Engineer.  How and why I started working as a Highway Design Engineer at the Iowa DOT as a Mechanical Engineer is another story for another day.  But this posed a challenge because I needed to write bullets that were not lying, that were reflective of what I actually did, but I was applying as a Mechanical Engineer to an entry level position at a Fortune 100 company, a large off road ag industry leader.  Definitely not a Civil or Construction engineering job.

This required me to learn and understand the concept of competencies.  I recrafted my bullet points trying to highlight the competencies that the examples demonstrated, more so than the technical skills and knowledge that they embodied.  This is necessary because you have to know your audience.  I didn’t want a mechanical engineer to see my resume and not easily be able to understand my bullet point.  If someone can’t understand the bullet point, how will they know if it’s something that should impress them or not?  They really can’t.  Well not easily anyways.  My job was to make it as easy as possible for a recruiter or hiring manager to be impressed by my accomplishments on my resume (bullet points).

I crafted every bullet in the following format: What is the accomplishment, how do you measure it to prove it is an accomplishment, how did I accomplish it, and what was the impact it had?  Notice I am using the word accomplishment here.  I didn’t put any “job description like activities” or “role responsibilities” on my resume.  Each bullet should be an accomplishment that I’ve done.  Something I think is worthy of bragging.  I want to brag to any potential employer about what I accomplished, not some checkbox that I checked that was part of my job description.

Once my resume was revamped I was ready to apply.  When I went and found the job posting I wanted to apply for, I tweaked my resume even further to match up with the job posting.  Now keep in mind, this was before ChatGPT and other LLMs existed.  This was all hand done, each bullet adjusted, each work experience adjusted, different elements in the job posting highlighted in my bullet points.  The resume was the most lined up with the “job duties/responsibilities”, the “must haves”, and the “nice to haves” in the job posting.  I left nothing else in my experience on the table that I couldn’t apply to this job posting specifically.

Off my application went.

The first step was a phone screen.  I knew this phase would only be a short call, maybe 20-30 minutes.  These were mostly some general job fit questions, how much experience I had, what my experience was like, what was I interested in, my favorite class/project in school, am I open to relocate, can I make it to the recruiting conference that was going to be happening in Pittsburgh, PA.  After giving honest, strategic answers to all of these questions, making sure to show real enthusiasm and excitement to work for this company, the call ended.  I made extra sure to relay that I was interested in this company, their products, their technology, what they did, and where I thought they were headed, based on the research I did online and through people in my network who worked at the company or had done research related to their work at ISU.  You really don’t want to come off here as someone “just looking for any job” with “any company.”  This screams, “please, God, just hire me, I need a job, please!!”

Next, I got the nod that I had an interview scheduled at the recruiting event in Pittsburgh.  I booked a ticket, a hotel, and started to get my interview examples together.  This is where the bulk of the heavy lifting comes when preparing for an interview round, in my opinion.

 This is where most people fall flat on their face. They don't spend enough time to dig up the details of all their examples that they plan to use in their interviews. I went through every single work experience that I wanted to use in these interviews and I made a matrix. I had one column for the situation in the task and one column for the actions and one column for the results. I thought of every single example that I could possibly have applied to this interview and every single example that in some way is some kind of an accomplishment or something worth bragging about this is a bigger list than just what's on my resume but it also includes many of the things on my resume. One of the best things you can do for yourself in this situation is if you've already been keeping track of all this information periodically as you work month to month week to week year to year. But most people rarely do this and when they start preparing for an interview it becomes time to start combing through the Rolodex in their mind and in their experiences to pull out all these Nuggets and different accomplishments that they've done that they can use during the interview. The real key to success here is to think of every single detail that you can possibly think of and populate the Situation and Task column the Actions column and the Results column. The more detail you can put in at this point the easier it will be to figure out which examples you have are four and 5 star examples and which examples maybe just don't have enough content around them to really make the final cut in your interview examples.

 After I went through and documented all of my examples in excruciating detail which took a lot of time going back through old data old projects saved files that I have different visuals presentations I've given emails notes documents shared drives PowerPoints onenotes Every single thing you could imagine has been combed and every detail has been gleaned and put into this directory of any of your examples. Now it's time to go through and figure out which ones are the 4 star and 5 star examples.

 Most of the times when a star interview or a behavioral based interview is being conducted the interviewers are rating the answers that you give on a scale of one to 5 stars. The scale could be different but the concept is the same so we're going to assume for this example that we're talking about a one star to a 5 star rating 1 star being the lowest most least impressive rating 5 star being the highest. One star is basically this person is horrible and it's shocking that they're even able to put their pants on by themselves in the morning. 2 star is this candidate or this answer wasn't very good it didn't really answer the question it wasn't impressive maybe the interviewer sorry maybe the interviewee had communication issues the example wasn't even clear it was hard to follow hard to understand what they did hard to understand the impact very subpar and just wouldn't even be considered acceptable as an answer for the question that was asked and it doesn't really demonstrate the competency that was asked either. 3 star is considered sufficient meaning you won't be disqualified from the position but you weren't any really anything impressive nothing to write home about no one is going to have their hats blown off by the answer that you gave it answers the question checks the box and it's basically saying you know you answered with the minimum answer you need and demonstrated the minimum amount of that competency to be considered considered for this position. A four star answer goes a level beyond that and it really impresses the interviewers and it shows that you demonstrated this competency pretty clearly your communication was clear you were able to communicate the example the impact that you had the situation the task that you were assigned the actions that you specifically took the results of those actions and maybe you went a little bit above and beyond in some aspect during your example and you didn't just do what you were asked but you went a little bit beyond that. A five star example is really showing that you are a rock star so not only did you demonstrate the cometency clearly you communicated the example very well you highlighted the situation task actions and results extremely clearly you went above and beyond the call of duty and not only that but you somehow found a way to impact other areas like you improve the process you improved some tool that even allowed you to do that work you found a way to transfer what you did to a different problem and implemented over there maybe you put together some training to educate people on the work that you did and how they can apply to their area maybe you conducted that training maybe presented it to a bigger audience you just are an absolute rock star knocked it out of the park demonstrated the competency went above and beyond and you had a bigger impact than even the initial scale and scope of the assigned situation and task ever was meant to be.

 So at this point I go through and I rate all my examples which ones are one star 2* 3*4*5 * and obviously we hope you don't have any one * 2 * 3 * if we have something that's a 3 * just because there isn't enough content we never want to invent content and lie and say we did things that we didn't do so we try to filter us down to the 4 star and 5 star examples. My goal in this interview looking at a time slot of an interview for an hour assuming that I'm going to have somewhere between 5 and 7 questions is having somewhere around 15 interview examples I looked at all my examples and I picked out all the 5 star examples right away that left me with about five examples that weren't 5 star so I had ten 5 star examples and I picked the five top four star examples that I had to use for the interview. At this point you want to add any finishing touches any detail you can think of to these examples to make them stand out even more and again this is the point where you want to go into excruciating detail even though you won't be able to memorize it all and it might not all be relevant for every single question that comes up that you can use this example for but to document that in such excruciating detail makes it very usable later for a whole wide range of questions that could come from different competencies because now you have all that detailed documented it's just a matter of pulling from it when you need it.

 The next step is practice. This is somewhere else where people fall flat and they don't do nearly enough practice. I started interviewing a few weeks before the conference happened and before I knew I was going to actually be interviewing. Most people don't start practicing for their interview until a couple days or a day before the interview and this is just not enough time to fully let all your examples really sink into your head and get embedded in your memory so that you know them just like you know your own last name. O the key here is to go through all your examples now I went through all my 15 examples over and over and over and over I practice in the morning before I went to work I practiced on my lunch break I practiced when I got off work 7 days a week over and over and over until all the details of my examples become ingrained in my memory just like my own last name. Once you have your examples memorized to this level of detail with all the detail that you've poured into them you now basically have this ocean of examples that can be molded and twisted and shaped to fit almost any question that an interviewer can ask you you know that you're only going to get between 5 and 7 questions in a behavioral based interview and you're only going to see five competencies to seven competencies so there's no way they can give you a question that these 15 questions that have so much detail can't address from some angle or the other.

 After all this preparation the next step was mock interviews. This is another place a lot of people fall short. They either don't have friends or people in their network who will give them their time to do a mock interview or they have folks who will give them their time but don't necessarily have the competence and the knowledge to be able to give good feedback and be able to help them improve during the interview or a whole slew of other reasons like not wanting to take the time one of the biggest problems that I've seen with people in my career is thinking that they're better at interviewing than they are so they don't think they need to spend as much time doing mock interviews and that they're really strong interviewers when in fact when you practice with them they're not strong interviewers. So after my first week of preparation and preparing all the examples in excruciating detail and memorizing all my examples like the back of my hand I spent the next week doing mock interviews and this was one to two full 1 hour mock interviews every day for a week. And I'll say if you don't have a partner who is very knowledgeable in interviewing it helps to at least have somebody because sitting and interviewing across from somebody even if they're not very knowledgeable it gives you a chance to practice that if you practice that in a quiet room by yourself you don't have the same level of realism of an interview at least this is somebody that you know sitting across from you even if they don't have a lot of engineering knowledge or they're not very good at interviewing or or being interviewed it gives you a sense of realism you get to practice talking about your examples in front of somebody else.

 So I practice interviewing with former college friends with current colleagues people in my network other professionals and family members. The key here is to try to get the most qualified people you can to donate their time and help you practice but if you can't it's OK just to get anybody you know that can sit there you can print off some example behavioral based interview questions or technical interview questions whatever kind of interview you're preparing for hand it to them and justice let them listen and ask them to write down any notes things that seemed off things that you know you didn't communicate well even if they're not technically you know in the same domain as what you're talking about or even professionals at all really in the same kind of field at all they can still give you valuable feedback about how clear you speak your pace you know how confusing your examples were and how easy it was to follow. And there is an upside to this too if you only have people who aren't really technical and aren't really knowledgeable in your domain it's actually a good opportunity to try to see if you've made your interview examples as easy to understand for people who don't know your domain as possible because you never know when you interview at a big company you might be interviewing for a software engineering position but there might be some software engineering hiring manager who pulls in a colleague in some other area adjacent to his team to help interview who might be for example in vehicle testing or something thing and you want to be able to make sure that you validate that your examples you're giving are easy to follow for somebody who isn't necessarily in the same domain as you and doesn't know all the same lingo and jargon that you have all your examples explained as.

 So now most of the heavy lifting has been done we've revised our resume We've made every bullet point an accomplishment and every bullet point has been accompanied by a metric to measure that accomplishment and how that accomplishment was accomplished what the impact was we catered our resume precisely and exactly to the post that we're applying for we applied we passed the phone screen in the phone screen we showed a lot of excitement and a lot of energy towards this company and what they work on what their goals are and what their products are and the types of work that you'll be doing there And we've got the interview lockdown that we started preparing for we prepped all of our interview examples in excruciating detail and we listed out situations task actions and results for every single example we vetted them for the 5 star examples pulled those out and then filled the remaining slots with 4 star examples we practiced and memorized those interview examples to every last detail at the back of our hand then we practiced for a week intensely 1 to 2 full 1 hour mock interviews every single day we are now extremely extremely well positioned to go to this interview and do an amazing job in this interview.

 So next I flew out to Pittsburgh in the airport I was practicing my interview examples on the flight I was practicing my interview examples in the Uber to the hotel I was practicing my interview examples in the hotel I was practicing my interview examples and in the Uber to the conference I was practicing my interview examples and waiting outside the door to go into my interview I was practicing my interview examples. O the key here is practice practice practice practice practice which is why I preach that getting to an interview and performing well think of it like an iceberg you know most of the iceberg is underwater that's your preparation so 95 to 99% of your success in an interview is going to be what you did before you got to the interview it doesn't necessarily performing well in the interview you can think of that portion like performing in the Olympics some Olympians they only get you know 30 seconds to five minutes to actually perform but they've spent four years training and preparing to show their greatest performance in that 30 seconds to five minutes or whatever it is during the Olympics that's how you should think of an interview.

 So I went into the interview and I interviewed with a few different folks who were pretty laid back they made the environment pretty comfortable for me help me be at ease and I started in on my interview answers and one of the 1st things I did was made sure I asked them what their backgrounds were what their positions were and this helped me kind of Gage what type of domain that they worked in so I could also help try to change my examples a little bit make them more understandable explain terminology I don't want to be using acronyms for things that aren't common knowledge for people who don't work in the same domain as the examples that I'm using and I went through the entire interview and concluded the interview. A few key points to note about the interview I think a lot of people are kind of taken back when they're asked a question that they don't really think they have a solid answer to and they feel a little bit uncomfortable to sit and pause for that one or two minutes to think of a really good example to answer that question so you know expert tip here do you need to get comfortable with that silence it's OK if somebody asks you a question in an interview it's OK to say hey can I have one or two minutes to think about that question a little bit longer I really want to give you an example that lines U well with what you're asking. It's also OK to ask for clarification you know ask them what did you mean by this question what exactly are you trying to understand from this question you know could I answer the question from this angle do you want it answered from that angle it's OK to have a conversation a lot of people get into an interview and they're they're so you know frozen and they're so like stuck where they feel like they can't really have a conversation with the interviewers and that helps I mean that also helps defuse the situation a little bit and and at the very worst if he really feels stuck it's completely OK to ask to come back to that question at the end too and say hey I really don't think I have a great answer right now can I have some time to think about this let's just get this and go go to the rest of the interview and come back at the end and all these different things that you use what you might think of as like stalling for time really show maturity in how you handle a situation where you're kind of stuck and in trouble right at the end of the day a lot of these people interviewing you are going to end up being your colleagues maybe and it gives them satisfaction and maybe some afety and security to know that hey if we hire this person they're a person who has the maturity to kind of work with their team communicate what's going on tell us out loud that you're kind of stuck or that you need a little bit of time to think about it and has the maturity to take a step back and ask for some time to think about it or ask to come back to it at the end of the interview so these things won't really hurt you a ton and they shouldn't really severely negatively impact your chances of doing well in the interview I think on the contrary they show signs of maturity and signs of of you know good practices that might even come through later when you're a colleague of these people.

 So I think the interviewers when they left the conference I went back home and and waited to hear back any news about how the interview went.

 I got word about a week and a half later that I was scheduled for the second round of interviews which we're going to be at the company's headquarters in Moline Illinois. At this point I felt pretty confident because I felt like I prepared very well for my first round of interviews and I think I did pretty good in terms of my score and II could tell from the feedback that the interviewers gave me that I did a pretty good job but I wanted to take the next round of interviews to the next level so I unleashed kind of a secret weapon that a mentor of mine helped me put together and really taught me about and that was the visual aid binder. So I started preparing related to all my 15 examples any kind of visual aids that I could put together whether that was you know charts diagrams anything that could be used as a visual description of the project that I did you know some of the actions I took some design examples and some of the results that happened so any kind of a visual that could be used for someone to better understand the project understand what you did understand the situation of the task kind of pain point aspect to the project or to understand what results happened and what impact you had visually if they can see that you know a picture is worth 1000 words. So I got the word back that I got the second round of interviews and I booked my travel to head to Moline and I had my binder all set and ready to go and headed off to Moline for the interview.

 When I got to the room where there were a bunch of other people waiting to be interviewed I noticed as I pulled out my binder and put it on my table and a lot of other people in that interview room noticed it as well and I heard some murmurs around the room to the effect of Dang that's a really good idea I wish I would have thought of that you know I never even thought to bring a visual aid so I knew right away that this was going to be a huge plus and a huge added bonus and benefit not only does it show the interviewers that you were so well prepared and thought ahead to bring a visual aid I mean it shows the professionalism the only effort that you put in to get to this point it shows that  You understand that seeing is believing.   and in any interview setting anything that can put you over the edge anything that give you a competitive advantage make you stand out from the rest of the crowd as either more competent more prepared more professional better to work with better to get along with Anything that can put you over the top and put you past the competition is going to be a good thing and sometimes it's those little competitive edges that make the difference between the person who gets the offer and the person who gets told we're sorry somebody out just somebody else just edged it out a tiny bit more than you.

 So I had two more interviews that day between two different panels both interviews went really well and the binder visual aid turned out to be a really big hit I handed it to the interviewers at the beginning of the interview and each section had a tab with a label on it for every interview example so when they would ask me a question I would say Oh yeah this reminds me of this time that I worked on X project and I'd say if you can just turn to the tab titled X they had turned to it and have a bunch of visual aids and as I'm answering and describing the project they can be flipping through and looking and seeing getting clarification on things and a lot of times after the question I'd get a couple questions about the visual aid the follow up you know maybe they're impressed by something hey can you explain this 0 that's really interesting so it became like a very very powerful addition to the answers that I'm giving verbally they can kind of see the projects appreciate them understand them and I think this helped a lot too Bridging the gap between where I came from like a civil construction engineering type of job and a lot of examples two more engineered like mechanical engineering product engineering type of work at a Fortune 100 company having those visual aids made things a lot clearer in the examples rather than just trying to describe everything in words it becomes very difficult when you're talking to people who are mostly not in the same domain as you. So I felt like the binder visual aid thing that's a big pro tip and I really encourage everybody to do that if you're interviewing a very simple way to put yourself over the over the top and stand out from the competition and I think all the interviewers greatly appreciated and thought it was a really good idea and a very impressive especially for somebody an engineer applying for an entry level position with a Fortune 100 company.

 So again I thank the interviewers I headed back home and waited to hear back about the interview. Within a couple weeks I got the call and I got the job offer. I think it's very clear looking back if I had to recap you know the main things that really that really stood out as I think setting me apart making me successful here are number one making the resume stand out making the resume show the most relevant experiences to the job and restructuring all my bullets to show the most impact as possible and to all be bragging points and not just be job description type bullet points refactoring my resume to fit the job description specifically in terms of what the job description was itself what the requirements were to apply and be eligible and what the must haves were and then applying for the job and then preparing all my interview examples like I said most people they fall flat on this and don't put nearly enough effort into gathering all their interview examples and again if you can do this over time every couple weeks every month set a reminder on your calendar to document these things that when you get to an interview O all these things are already at your fingertips now you just have to refresh your mind about them you don't have to go back and try to think of things that happened two years ago and project details and all that kind of stuff. I also think the amount of practice that I put in I spent a lot of time memorizing my examples to the point where it was basically like someone asked me my date of birth or my Social Security number and when the examples get that embedded and ingrained in your memory and when you go to the interview it's any question they ask you you can just you know pull from your examples like doing a Google search from the Internet and just you can extract any example to fit any competency explain in any different light in any different angle to fit the question exactly and precisely the way it's asked especially the negative questions a lot of times people get stumped by the you know tell me about a time you made a decision too fast and you had to change it you know and but if you know your examples to that level of detail it becomes very easy to just alter them twist them look at them from a different light to fit any potential question you get asked in the interview. The other big thing that helped me a lot like I said was the mock interviews many people do 1 mock interview maybe 2 before an interview you know doing one or two a day for a week just to sheer confidence you have in speaking the amount of times you've walked through an example the flow that you have through it the pace timing yourself knowing how much time you're using for a question not you know using up all the time on the first 3 questions then running short in the last couple questions Brainstorming with all those mock interviews at the end how you can improve what things maybe you left out and having the people who helped you prepare and do the mock interviews asking you like potential follow up questions potential questions that people might be curious about based on your examples maybe you left some details out maybe you added too much detail somewhere else and it got boring I mean doing a full week one or two full mock interviews a day at the end of that week I mean you are just so solid and ready to interview that you feel almost like you just want to say hey like interview me right now I don't want to wait another 23 days to come to the interview like let's just do it now i'm ready let's go. In the final part I think is delivery you know delivering the interview answer as well catering your pace your tone the terminology use based on the audience who you're talking to reading their body language reading their cues if they feel bored to speed up you know if they look like they're struggling to keep up and take notes to slow down if you know they're not from the same domain field as you don't use terminology that won't be understandable to them explain things in easy to understand way for that audience get feedback have a dialog in the interview you know ask them to slow down ask them to re re explain a question to restate a question to clarify a question so how you conduct yourself in the interview be professional conduct it as if you're going to be these people's colleague and you want to show them that you work well together you can communicate well with them and working with you is going to be enjoyable thing because at the end of the day people don't want to hire somebody who they don't want to work with I mean you can't just answer the questions right check the boxes people also there's a human element they know they're gonna have to work with you eventually day after day so you want to demonstrate that you're a person who people can stand being around and working with. And the last element I think was the binder you know I think that was the icing on the cake not a lot of people nobody else showed up at least in my round of interviews with a visual aid that I saw and that's just one more level to differentiate you from the crowd and I will say if you show up with the binder visual aid and you haven't prepared and you haven't memorized your examples and you have bad examples and there's not a lot of detail and they're not impressive the binder itself is not going to get you the job but it's that extra layer when you have all the other pieces in place you have great examples strong examples a lot of good detail a lot of what you did you painted the pain very very very well so people appreciate the actions and the results and the impact you had you demonstrate the results you showed how you went above and beyond you showed how you added value outside of the scope of what the original situation and task even were maybe you trained other people you let a training or a presentation about what you did and now you have the mind of the visual aid to help people walk with you on that journey through each example to not be confused and to have even more clarity and recision on what you're talking about it's just the absolute icing and the cherry on the cake that makes you stand out from the crowd.

 And that is the full story of how I got my job offer and got hired at a Fortune 100 company.
