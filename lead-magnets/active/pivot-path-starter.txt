This is the detailed story of how I first pivoted into an embedded software role without going back to school or going back for any formal training or expense/long bootcamps.  The starting point in all of this is really even before I started to actually acquire any skills in software development or before I even formally decided in my mind to make the switch.  Let’s back up a little.

The reason that I started to lean towards the idea of pivoting into software as a domain for my career in the first place was that I was paying close attention to the things happening around me at Deere and in the world.  This is a big moment to pause and derive some lessons.  A lot of people get so tunnel visioned and are so deep in their work they don’t necessarily take the time to lift their head up and see what is going on around them.   If I just keep chugging away and doing hard work and keeping their focus on the trenches and not trying to understand how the entire landscape is changing around them and without having a really good grasp on how they're going to fit into that new landscape if there's going to be a place for them or if the landscape that they're currently in is going to have shrinking opportunities or growing opportunities and what areas that they could possibly pivot into might have greener pastures more opportunity more room for growth and promotion and they just keep plugging away in the same area. So this was a big thing for me I noticed that software was becoming very big in every industry you know software's been very big for a long time and in the software world but it started to really really bleed into all other areas and John Deere had been pivoting into becoming a very tech heavy company having a huge focus on precision AG and A and a lot of public information is out there about was out there at the time about different acquisitions that Deer made to make themselves more strategically positioned in the software area to become more competitive and to increase their the gap between them and their competition as far as precision AG technology was concerned. We also had a new CEO at John Deere pretty early on to when I got hired that tended tended to talk and emphasize this new precision AG and tech stack focus of John Deere and and how it would deliver more value to our customers and how it would make our products better and allow our customers customers to be more productive and ultimately more profitable which is good for us good for our business and and good for our customers. So that was the main driving factor the secondary driving factor was when I was a mechanical engineer I was testing engines and I thought to myself that you know all these engines have software that runs them and you know software that controls them make sure that they're functioning properly and delivering their value and it probably make me a better mechanical engineer if I learn a little bit about the software that way when I come back to being a mechanical engineer I'll be more well rounded I'll understand the software element controls element more of the engines and I'll just be a more well rounded diverse mechanical engineer who you know is savvy in the software world and I kind of know what's going on there and I mean it'll help me in all facets of my mechanical career in the future and at that point III was planning to go I was thinking about dabbling in software but ultimately coming back to mechanical and you know established my career there as I did have a bachelor's degree and was close to finishing up a master's degree in mechanical engineering so it was by no means thinking of permanently switching over to any kind of embedded software development or system engineering or anything like that. So with those two things in mind I started to kind of think of a plan and the first thing I had to really figure out was do I even like software right an important thing to understand when you're pivoting is you really want your pivot to have three things you want your pivot to be to a place that a you enjoy B it's something you're good at and see something that has value or opportunity you know in the near term and in the middle term and the long term in the future so I already took care of the aspects of you know does it have value because I saw for our my company John Deere it was clearly the the value area that was going to be unlocked more and more in the future and then also just knowing outside of John Deere in every industry software is growing you know having more software knowledge would only increase your marketability in the marketplace and increase your skill set and the tools available to you in any kind of company environment by and large so the value question was answered then the question of the questions remained will I be good at it and do I enjoy it So in order to do that I started my pivot journey with trying to tinker and learn some software skills on my own So I first started doing this in the form of a ver some very very basic online what you call a Boot Camp. No these aren't i'm not talking about paid boot camps where you pay thirty forty thousand dollars and it's a one year program or a six month program i'm talking about like udemy dot com i'm talking about Youtube i'm talking about Coursera i'm talking about these coding tutorial type of boot camps where you could you know get through a boot camp working you know maybe a couple hours a week finish the program in two months or something like that this is not I'm not talking about the full expensive $40,000 you know multi month full time boot camp fully immersive learning everything about coding in a really condensed accelerated program That's not what I'm talking about. So I first started with these free resources online going through them learning the fundamentals of coding you know how to write code and very early on I realized you know it's hard to stay engaged and it's hard to stay motivated without an actual project that you have to work on that you or try to get value out of something that's important to you you know it's difficult to stay motivated just from tutorial to tutorial to tutorial you really have to have a project that has some meaning to you and is going to deliver some kind of value to you so you stay motivated to work on it and when you hit a roadblock you're motivated to get through that roadblock and it makes it a lot more interesting because as you make progress on that project you start to see how that value gets unlocked And you're excited about the results of the project because they have some impact on you it's not just some arbitrary exercise like some homework assignment from a class that you don't really care about. So I first started to apply some of these software concepts I was learning and skills in basic scripting and Matlab scripting to my graduate program course that I was taking so I was able to do a lot of interesting things with some data analysis and let's call it data cleaning organizing you know presenting in certain types of charts and graphs just basically doing a lot of data science and data data analysis with the help of a bunch of scripting that I learned from MATLAB from our programming language and it made a lot of the work that I was doing in my graduate courses a lot easier and it really boosted my productivity there So when I started to see that time getting shaved off to accomplish some of these things in my graduate program I really felt like OK I kind of have the foundation to try to maybe apply some of these to the current role that I'm in right now. This was probably the period too where I understood that I enjoyed it so at this point I wasn't an advanced descriptor coder whatever you want to call it I was still at a very basic level but I think I had checked that box of do I enjoy it I mean I think I enjoyed the logic aspect of it I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it you know trying to figure out resolve bugs resolve issues with the code why it's not working then the excitement you get when you get the output that you expected and the output that you've been working so hard on is a really you know enjoyable moment to unlock that value and to see it kind of working before your eyes it was just really amazing process that I found of you know this quick response and almost instantaneous feedback of writing some code writing some script you know it processes a bunch of data processes a bunch of information for you and it outputs some kind of output that you want and it's like this really small short close feedback loop that you get this positive feedback almost instantaneously so that was very rewarding so it started to check the box of enjoyment too so I kind of started to feel like now I had those three elements in terms of this pivot kind of checked off at least you know somewhat confidently explored that I felt like OK there was value in pivoting into software from a company career growth standpoint opportunity standpoint I felt like I was fairly good at it because I kind of picked it up pretty quickly and I felt like I enjoyed it because of the aspects that I mentioned. Oi wanted to build on those skills and I'd finished up my coursework so again I needed some projects that were meaningful and that would let me practice these skills and and build them and and increase my knowledge in some kind of an activity that is meaningful and you know I'm expecting to see some results on and that has some impact on me so I started to implement this into my into my job so at the time I was a mechanical PV and V engineer running engines in test cells diesel diesel diesel engines and most of the testing was either some design change you know on a component or validation for emissions or you know a new engine series model that's that we're testing kind of in PDP type of activity But most of them at the end of the day spit out some giant you know source of data after the test runs you know there's a lot of different data that we collect on the engine you know there's sensor data and there's different internal data that gets collected on the engine and part of the job of the PVP engineer is to process that data try to gain some some basic insights from it and try to make sure that first of all the tests they ran correctly the engine was healthy when it ran and then try to make some sense of that data and bring some kind of conclusion to those those test results and ultimately share those with senior engineer and and the stakeholders who maybe from design or from other groups who are trying to get this engine validated and and you're running most of the testing for them so post test data processing and data analysis is kind of where I decided to apply these skills that I had learned now and applied to my graduate course study. So I started writing a bunch of scripts that cut down a lot of the time that it took me to process the data after the testing you know it's kind of amazing when you told her to see that you can write a script that cuts down an activity that normally takes you you know hours down to seconds and spits out the you know graphs and charts things to use in presentations to present the data in seconds and have a lot of this stuff automated so I started to get much deeper into scripting using all these tools to apply value to the role that I was currently in until I got to the point where basically most of my post test data processing was pretty automated and pretty scripted and it kind of felt like A superpower at that point to be honest and I started to get other Mechanical Engineers around me kind of interested in it and taught a couple other people how to kind of write some scripts and was sharing my scripts with people where it was applicable and things were going really well at that point. The next step for me at that point was I kind of still knew my limitations and I kind of knew that I was you know knowledgeable enough now to be dangerous but I wanted to get some better knowledge and more in depth knowledge on some of the things that I was doing so I ended up partnering up with a couple of engineers who are on the Applied Mechanics team who had much deeper software scripting you know coding knowledge than I did and we did a couple other projects together that delivered some value for PVNV and I used that as kind of a you know a paired program and a paired project kind of environment where I was able to learn a lot from them and I was able to take little pieces from them and go work on some tasks for a couple days come back get some more information and it was this kind of joint venture but I learned a lot from it and then was able to build some tools that added a lot of value to PVNV so after all that was done I felt like I had really demonstrated enough in my current role and II really used a lot of these skills and tools that I that I acquired to actually have a pretty significant impact on my current role you know it wasn't a negligible impact that didn't really move the needle forward it was something that that stood out and that really if any manager was really paying attention it was something that really increased productivity immeasurable substantial amount. I would say a key couple of things to highlight at this point right now in the story is that you know I didn't really wait for anybody to approve of me to go out and learn these new skills. I mean one of the most important things to mention is nobody told me to do it number one II saw the writing on the wall of where the company is headed where industry is headed what skills would be useful and valuable and then I went out kind of played around with them made sure that they would be valuable made sure that I was good at them made sure that I liked them because if one of those components is missing you know the pivot is is is not going to be as enjoyable as you think so if you find something that's going to be very useful and you like it but you're not good at it it's gonna be tough. If you find something that's going to be you like and you're good at but it's not useful you're not going to make much money or have much opportunity there you're not going to like it. You know if you find something that's very useful you're good at it but you don't like it you're going to be miserable right so you have to really have those three things so I validated that. I didn't ask anyone's permission to go and do this and learn these things So this is kind of a big lesson in initiative you know a lot of times the pivot nobody is just waiting for you to pivot or hoping that you pivot or you know gonna push you to it or gonna really like drive you and push you to do these extra curricular type of things that take up more time and you might have to spend time outside of work on you know no one's really pushing you for that so there has to be a lot of self awareness self motivation and this is something you're taking on by yourself. You know a lot of people are concerned that this might require some more time and the answer is you know most likely absolutely yes in the beginning it's going to require more time. You're going to have to put in more time trying to learn these new skills you might have to put in a little bit of time outside of work you might have to put in some time before work after work work over some lunch breaks a little bit on the weekend but eventually as you learn these skills you know if you're learning skills that you can leverage in the current role eventually they're going to start to have you know dividends that they pay in your current role to make you more efficient so ultimately even if you don't really pivot to a new role they're only going to help your current role improve usually. You can't always make that line up they're not all going to have an exact one to one impact on your current role and on your current productivity but if you're pursuing the right types of skills they should have there should be a pretty good chance that they have some kind of an impact on the productivity in your current role and then whatever you put it put in as extra time to get those skills you should be getting that time back you should be seeing benefit and even if it doesn't mean you're going to have a reduced work week for a period of time you're going to be more productive in your current role so even if you stay in the current role being more productive being able to do more with less I mean that should set you up for promotion conversations in the future anyways right so whether you follow through with the pivot or you don't it's going to benefit you somehow you're either going to be able to pivot to the area you wanted to pivot to or it's going to help you accelerate in your current role if you implement those things in your current role to any decent level of execution. Now the next step for me was finding the role that I wanted to pivot to so a big part of this too was networking ahead of the pivot I spent a lot of time networking with other managers I had one on ones with managers in groups that I thought I'd be interested in pivoting to and trying to learn more about what they did what they worked on what their day-to-day work life was like and finding some groups that I thought hey I'd really like to try to move there. And then I set up one on ones with people on those teams try to understand you know what their day was like what the work was actually like what skills they felt were very important to have what gaps they think that I had in my current resume I shared a lot of my experiences and my my my resume with them including the new skills that I learned and I was really trying to probe you know as many different managers and and peers in those groups as I could to understand you know what they worked on was it interesting to me could I add value and then where do I stand in terms of what skills they need and maybe do I have some skills and things that their team doesn't have that would even give me a competitive advantage advantage to pivoting there even if I'm a little bit weaker on the software knowledge side for example but I'm stronger somewhere else stronger in communication skills or team building or leadership or process improvement or you know agile methodology understanding or whatever it is you know so you try to minimize the gaps that you have and try to maximize the skills that you have that can be applied to that team and possibly some of the some of the you know blind spots that that team has or gaps in in skills and knowledge that that team has and try to bring those two things as close together as you possibly can. So after I identified that group and talked with two of the managers that I was really interested in working for it came down to one of them and he agreed to have me on his team so I got the position on his team and his team was was kind enough and he was he was kind enough to to to see the other skills that I had brought to the table and some of the other some of the motivation behind it so I will say that a big part of this too is when you when you do the Trojan horse methodology and you build the skills and the knowledge that you need to pivot to this role it tells that manager a lot about who you are. When a manager sees that you've already gone on your own and done all these things and gained all these skills and knowledge by yourself without your manager telling you to and it wasn't required for your previous role it shows that you are motivated. So not only does it show that you're motivated but you are capable right so two of the biggest things that a manager wants to see is on somebody who's going to come to their team or they want to come to their team is are you how motivated are you and how capable are you in the 3rd aspect is probably character right are are you honest are you a good person are you good to work with are you a good teammate etcetera etcetera etcetera. So this is a key point of emphasis here you know when you use a Trojan horse strategy not only are you showing that manager that hey I have the skills that I need to be successful in that role but also the effort it took to get those skills it tells you that I'm not messing around see this is the aspect that a lot of people don't understand is you know there's a big difference between telling a manager hey give me the role get me on your team and I'll prove to you after you do that I can add value that I can learn that I'll pick up these skills that I have the motivation the drive to learn them and implement them and do a good job you know that's asking a lot for managers to trust that you're going to do all that stuff. But by doing the Trojan horse method you don't need that manager to have that blind faith and that trust you demonstrate that so now they can see that you have the ability to learn these new skills they can see that you had the motivation to go out and learn it yourself they can see that you applied what you learned to your current role they can see that you are aware of the gaps that you had in knowledge they can see that you identified an area that you think you'd be able to add more value in and where your career could grow more They can see that you reached out to a team who might have some gaps that you could possibly fill and benefit them in so it paints a much better picture of who you are just in the fact that you did that coming to that manager now and you're you're basically now you're saying I don't need you to have blind faith and trust that I will do these things I already have done these things or I've done them up to 70% of my capacity that I'm able to do them in my previous role and now I'd like to add that value to your team and to on your team close that 30% gap you know or get to 150% and become an expert with the help of your team. But now that manager doesn't have to feel like they're going out on a limb taking a gamble rolling the dice you know making a bet that you're going to be able to live up to what you're claiming you're going to be able to live up to and that's one of the most important key things about this entire process of of the pivot is instead of telling a manager you know give me the position and I'll show you you say look I've already showed you now give me the position that's the main difference eriod. So from that role I learned a lot about embedded C development and that team was very very very generous with their time and taught me a ton about embedded software development and CI went through their own many little boot camp that they had and I worked on that team for a while and learned a ton from them and that was my first pivot into an actual embedded software engineering role from there I moved into a systems engineering role and learn more about embedded software development through a systems engineer lens and the trend just kept going and I kept using kind of the same methodology and same skills that I've already talked about to move from position to position and a lot of other positions combined the aspects of the pivot method and the accelerate method to pivot to other different areas as well as to accelerate and get promoted and get recognized for the hard work and the value that I was adding to my to the role that I was in at the time and to the company that I was working for.
