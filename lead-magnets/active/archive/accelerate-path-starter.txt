The Promotion Protocol:

 The example that I want to walk through for the promotion protocol is the example of how I got promoted from being the Scrum master and the product owner for an embedded software team to being the software PVNV supervisor for a team in cropcare seating and tillage. Now in order to explain how this promotion happened I have to kind of back up to when I first came into the role on the embedded software team where eventually I did become the scrum master and the product owner for a controller on the team. Just to start out by emphasizing the value of network and the value of building a strong network and strong relationships with the people in your network and never burning any bridges or trying your best not to have any severely negative interactions or leave a team or have somebody else leave your team on bad terms with you I would state that the manager of this team that I joined and I became the Scrum Master and Product owner for had previously worked with me on the team in my previous role. She was the senior engineer on the team that I had the role in previous and she actually onboarded me onto that team trained me on that team and we did a lot of paired programming activities together when I was very new on the team so she showed me the ropes in a lot of ways and threw that on boarding and training process I was able to build a really strong relationship with her and that's kind of how we met and where our professional and personal relationship began. Now our relationship was pretty strong Fast forward a couple years later she left our team and went on to become the manager of an embedded software team in a different division of the company and that's when shortly after she left let's say somewhere around 6 to 8 months I saw a job posting I noticed that it was on her new team. So I reached out to her to set up a one on one and talked to her about why I was interested in the role and why I wanted to throw my hat in the ring potentially if I liked some of the things that she told me in the one on one that we had. So to cut to the chase on that part I found out that the roll would be good for me and that roll in and of itself was a promotion so but that's not the main focus of this story so I just wanted to know as a side note that I did get a promotion to somebody's team who I worked with previously and it's not the only reason they got the promotion but definitely having that rapport knowing that person working with them for a few years you know helps that manager already have a picture of who I am and what my work ethic is. Now in the conversation with that manager before I joined the team I was told that some of the soft skills or some of the more umm less technical skills you might call them in terms of team building leadership umm process improvement umm getting people kind of bought into a new system trying to get things organized trying to bring some structure and some process to help a team functions all these things were strong things that she saw in me and she felt like her team definitely was lacking and could benefit from. So it's always really good to move to a team where you know that the hiring manager has some perception of your skills and some perception of your strengths and they're transparent with you in telling you that their current team lacks those things and they're hoping that you can bring those things to their team to help fill some kind of a void and some kind of a gap on their team in terms of the things that you're strong at. So I applied for the position I interviewed I got the job offer and I joined her team and when I started on the team just like any other team that you would join I started onboarding I started trying to learn the code base I started trying to learn the product and that particular team at the time had two different controllers that it owned it had the EIC controller and it had the HVAC controller for large cabs at a Fortune 100 company. The first three to four months was a lot of onboarding training learning the code base understanding our workflow our processes and what types of projects that I'd be working on and I started supporting engineers in any way that I could on the team with mainly working on the EIC controller code helping with some basic features and some basic testing to help get those features built validated and into production. Around 3 to four months in to the job the manager of that team had basically asked the entire team if anybody wanted to become the Scrum Master of that team so the team at the time didn't have any formal Scrum master who really was taking the team through the you know Scrum process and through the different events that are supposed to be done on a Scrum team umm so there was nobody owning that role and there was nobody who was responsible for it and you'll find a lot of times with teams if if nobody's responsible for something then nobody's accountable for it and if everybody if everybody's responsible for something then ultimately nobody's responsible for it so there was this big void on the team and when the manager had asked the entire team if anybody wanted to take that position nobody volunteered and I ended up volunteering. So this is a pretty good learning moment to stop and pause and and and glean a couple things from number one sometimes you know you're in a position where you're just thrown this opportunity in front of you that is almost too good to be true and you know in normal circumstances you might have to fight for it you you know not physically obviously you might have to really compete for it but sometimes you know you just get this freebie thrown your way and you have this golden opportunity just land right on your lap. And a lot of people might not see it as a golden opportunity a lot of people see taking on more responsibility as more work more headache you know why should I take on more responsibility and more work if I'm not going to get a promotion or I'm going to get some kind of AA compensation differential for taking on that responsibility and that work and that is a completely backwards mindset to have if you're really interested in getting promoted faster than average. So I said yes and volunteered just because nobody else wanted to do it I was the youngest person on the team in terms of experience and I didn't think by any means I was the most qualified to do it I didn't think that I would be able to be the best at it but what I did have going for me is that I was willing to take on more work I was the person who was willing to take on more responsibility without any direct compensation increase without any direct kind of promotion increase or a promise of a promotion and that was a that's a big lesson for a lot of people out there trying to get promoted a lot of times you agree to take on more responsibility and more work that opens other opportunities up for you in terms of visibility and impact and the fruits of that come down the road. The fruits don't always show up at the time you make the deal I've had people in my career tell me you know why should I take on more responsibility why should I become the owner of this other program and absorb this other stuff if I'm not going to get a promotion I'm not going to get compensated for it. And there's a point to be made there you definitely don't want to become the martyr who just keeps taking on more work and the key is without visibility without getting you know credit for it in front of the right people and without the right people appreciating that you're taking on more responsibility and you also don't want to take on more work and not have that impact felt by people because then you do just become the silent martyr who is just taking on more work and slowly getting crushed and ground into a dust instead of getting recognized and elevated for all the extra work that they're taking on there is a fine line that you don't want to become that person for sure. But the point is taking out a big responsibility that gives you a lot of visibility gives you the chance to learn a lot of new skills it gives you the chance to have a leadership type position on the team is a pretty big step and if you're interested in career promotion and you're interested in moving up in the company it's a golden opportunity because you get to try on that hat without formally applying for a position interviewing and getting selected. So you kind of get this trial phase where you get to practice these you know skills that are similar to what a manager would practice Practice these skills where you're somewhat now influencing people's day to day work you're organizing the work you're organizing the backlog and you're kind of leading these meetings you're leading group meetings and team meetings calling on people checking on people's status updating things so you're getting a sense of kind of what it's like to lead a group without having a formal title change without having to apply for a new job interview for and have a ton more pressure on you So it's kind of like being the backup quarterback before you become the starting quarterback. As a result of becoming the scrum master for that entire team including being the scrum master for the EIC controller and the HVAC Controller on the team that came with the opportunity to do a formal training so the fact that I've never been a scrum master before although I'd worked on teams that have practiced Scrum or Agile in different ways I suggested to my manager that since I have this new role why don't I go try to find an intensive training that I can go take or I can learn how to become the most effective scrub master that I could possibly become for the team so that the team can benefit and I can do this correctly and deliver the most value to the team as the scrum master which makes a lot of sense. So this is not a very hard sell if you've already volunteered to take on a lot more responsibility for your team and how you're asking your manager to approve you go into a training to get the skills you need to be really good at that thing that you volunteered to do Any manager with half a brain would not turn that request down that would just be absolutely crazy unless you were in some kind of a really really really tight budget situation but in general times and normal situations that's not going to be something you're going to have to fight your manager on Too difficult. So now not only did we get the new position and experience of being the Scrum Master we've also now used that experience to leverage a training experience that's going to get us exposure to the best practices of Scrum and make us the best Scrum Master we can become which is going to also stretch our impact on the team and it's going to even further compound all the benefits we've gotten so far into actual deliverable results and benefits of how this team operates and functions and how this team understands that executes the Scrum methodology to get efficiency improvements quality improvements process improvements and all the benefits that come with successfully implementing Scrum methodology on an embedded software team. A month or so after the training I took the training to heart and I really tried to understand the material and I met with the main trainer of the intensive program 1 on one to kind of walk through some of our details on our team and some of the ideas that I had and what was going on at the time was we had one product owner on the team and the product owner owned both controllers so I was a scrub master for the whole team including both controllers the EIC controller and the HVAC controller. And we had a product owner who was the product owner for both controllers the EIC controller and the HVAC controller. And from the scrum training using a lot of what I learned in that training I started to understand that our team was too big so having one scrum team this big and one product owner who owned everything was just too much and in essence we should break our team down into two scrum teams around each controller who have a lot more in common with their daily work and what their deliverable is and what they work on so we had probably 12 to 15 people in that group calling it one scrum team owning two controllers and after a lot of thought from the scrum material that I learned in the training and talking with the trainers that I had gone through the training with I made a formal proposal to my manager to break the team up not into different reporting structures but just into two scrum teams so we had two scrum teams that would be separate and they would have one scrum team for the HVAC controller 1 scrum team for the EIC controller and I brought this proposal to my manager and she approved of it because the reasons that I laid out in the inefficiencies we had in how big the scrum team had become and the fact that they support two controllers and half the people on the team you know only care about this 1 controller the other half care about the other controller there's a lot of wasted time during our scrum ceremonies there's a lot of missed context people don't understand what's going on when somebody on the other controller is talking or presenting or bringing an issue forward so it doesn't make sense to have everybody in one scrum team between the two controllers. So since nobody else on the team wanted to be a Scrum master I volunteered my manager to remain the scrum master for both controllers so I became the Scrum Master for the SE controller and for the HVAC controller separately now this is another situation in which you know I'm kind of taking on more responsibility or more work for the good of the team and to drive the end objective of improving how the team functions overall So it's more work now to divide up all the scrum master ceremonies into two and to have twice as many meetings and meet twice as often with the two different groups but it's necessary to keep the 2 different groups working as efficiently as possible so it's better to have one person the scrum master of both teams have some redundancy and some decrease in efficiency rather than have all 15 people have some redundancy and decrease in efficiency. Because I volunteered to do that my manager saw that I was committed and saw that I was really concern for the welfare of the team and for the team to succeed and they wanted the team to be successful She asked me if I was OK with being the product owner for the other controller so the other issue that I brought forward in my proposal was that the product owner that we had who was product owner for the EIC and the HVAC controller was a very sharp engineer was very talented very smart was a really good engineer did a lot of work was you know in tune with everything he needed to do and and just did a terrific job from my point of view but it's just too much ground for one person to cover. So the proposal was to have a product owner for the EIC controller and have a product owner for the HVAC controller. And this is where I got another golden opportunity nobody else on the team wanted to be a product owner for the HVAC controller the original product owner was going to stay as the product owner for the EIC controller since it's a bigger code base there's more features more changes happening more complexity it's a much more complex controller and I ended up volunteering to become the product owner for the HVAC Controller. Now similar to the situation with becoming the Scrum Master I was not the most qualified person to be the product owner for the HVAC Controller there were plenty of people on the team who had been there longer than me much higher positions than me way more knowledgeable than me but this is a good example again just like the Scrum Master situation that not always the most qualified person gets the position sometimes you know you volunteer and you step up and you take on a lot of responsibility without compensation without promise of compensation increase without title increase and you do it because it's a golden opportunity for you to learn and to grow and to acquire those new skills in that new role without even having to apply for a position and you know interview for it and get a new position. O there's ways you can look at it some people look at it like I don't want to take on more responsibility without getting compensated that's not fair the company's taking advantage of me. I looked at these opportunities as golden opportunities for me to put on a new hat get new skills acquire new knowledge have a bigger impact have a wider impact and start to build some of the skills that would help turn me into a leader or a manager. And it's not just about building the skills that you would need to manage a team or lead a team in some capacity in the future it's also about figuring out if you like it. As I talked about in the pivot guide you want to find something that you're talented at that you enjoy and that is going to have some value and some green pastures and opportunity for you in the future. So you often want to use the same type of approach when you're looking at a promotion You know you don't want to just take a promotion because it's a promotion that's not a good thing to chase. You want to understand if you're going to be good at it are you going to like it and is it going to have a lot of value for you and is it going to have a lot of value to unlock other paths and other green pastures for your career in the future. So taking on these new responsibilities where you're not in a formal position change is a great way to test out the 1st two pieces of that are you good at it and do you enjoy it. Because now you get to try it out you get to put on this hat of being a team lead type of position as a Scrum master and as a product owner to understand do I like being responsible for this you know as a Scrum Master you are I was running the scrum ceremonies trying to organize the work for the team keep people on target a little bit understand where we're falling short run the retrospectives run the Sprint planning the Sprint reviews everything that a scrum master does and that's one aspect. The other aspect of being a product owner is organizing the backlog trying to interface with stakeholders outside of our team who have an interest and have features and things that need to be worked on either directly within our controller or the interface with our controller trying to line up features that need to be worked on and planned for ahead of time that are coming down the pipeline in future releases and future model year projects and programs. So not only do I get with these two roles the experience of somewhat leading a team giving people work direction but with the with the product owner you really get this sense of ownership of the product and you get this sense of ownership of the backlog and ownership and responsibility of delivering so you are speaking for a controller and making decisions about what we can deliver what we can't deliver what we should prioritize what makes sense in terms of our priorities as far as outside stakeholders are concerned as far as our own internal objectives and deliverables and features are concerned and those two hats together give you a very good taste of or gave me a very good taste of what it's going to be like leading a team managing a team in the future potentially if that opportunity ever presents itself to me. And this to me really was the foundation these were the foundational things that happened in that role that helped give me the skills and the knowledge and the confidence to even look outside of that role and start to think about becoming a manager of a team so I'd already got the chance and the opportunity to wear these different hats to be responsible for giving a team work direction and work responsibility to work on and to prioritize work to prioritize a backlog and understand and speak to what we can deliver what we can't deliver and what we should prioritize for delivering and all of those experiences helped give me confidence and give me the background knowledge and base I needed to even be able to think about moving on to becoming a manager of an engineering team in the future. The other aspect of this that really helped me is that when I took on all these responsibilities in these extra hats and rolls you start to form a strong relationship with my manager and I started to have better and deeper conversations in our 1 on ones about potential future career paths and advice about becoming a manager advice about career so a lot of it to me was showing that I'm invested and that I care about this team and my career and I'm taking things very seriously and I'm willing to take on more responsibility than I'm compensated for and more responsibility than I'm you know not being promoted for but that I'm doing it because I'm in it for the long haul i'm in it to add value to the group I mean currently the company overall and I'm looking for the long term payoff and I'm looking for long term growth not immediate results that kind of mindset.   So this started to give me access to my manager to have interesting conversations about my career where it's headed in conversations and one on ones with her manager and both of their peers so my manager's peers and my managers managers peers and started to get a lot of access to that entire umbrella of management in terms of 1 on ones career advice and finding out where my interests lie and what potential opportunities could be open to me in the future. The other great thing that this does is when you volunteer to take on big responsibilities like this and you execute well and you get positive feedback not only is your manager happy your manager becomes your advocate now so your manager now is is kind of bragging or your biggest you know advocate and evangelist to their manager and that kind of filters out and siphons up through the whole management umbrella and people start to hear your name mentioned positively in different meetings and conversations and it really starts to grease that wheel and people become accustomed to the idea that you're a high performer you're willing to take on more responsibility and you want to have a bigger impact on your area the department the division the company as a whole so that kind of greases that wheel for people to be receptive to starting to hear your name and see your name mentioned in bigger larger circles and when you throw your hat into the ring for other promotions and other opportunities it's not a surprise you know you're not some unknown name that's coming out of left field that nobody's ever heard of nobody knows much about you have this reputation that precedes you because you've built these relationships and experiences in people's minds where you're an own commodity. So all these experiences weighed very very very heavily when I went to get my promotion after this to being a software PBNP Supervisor. Not only did I already have network built up in the department of the division that I was applying for the promotion in through previous positions networking strategies but now I had a solid resume in a solid set of experiences that play similar to the pivot methodology of proving that I've already done some of this work. So when I'm sitting in a sitting in a room having a conversation about becoming the supervisor of a team and a manager I've already demonstrated a lot of these skills as the Scrum master of a team as the product owner of a team and I've had the chance to put on those hats and to actually demonstrate that I have 70 to 80% of what it takes to actually do the things that a manager of an engineering team would have to do and now they only have to have that faith in that 20% fill in the gap not you know in 80% that it's unfilled. So a lot of this promotion if I was to recap was AI got into the role as a Scrum Master and a product owner from previous relationships that helped me A to be able to reach out to that manager and have a much more down to earth conversation about if I would be a good fit for the role and if it would be a good fit for me and what type of strengths I would bring to the team the team was lacking and what kind of gaps I would have that would need to work on filling to be effective at adding value to the team and then also coming onto the team volunteering to take on two giant responsibilities of scrum Master and then using that scrum master responsibility to leverage it into going to a intensive training which opened up a proposal to break up the team into two scrum teams and two product owners and I got to have that 2nd product owner role all of that rolled up into more exposure more visibility with my manager her manager and the whole entire management structure above both of them and around them horizontal to them all of that rolled up when I went to apply for the first engineering manager position that made my case very very strong made my background my reputation my impact my commitment my ability to learn new things to lead to take ownership of something to learn something new to implement something I'd learned To restructure a team to find a better way for a team to operate and to exist and to keep the team on track to organize their work day to day run the Scrum ceremonies and to prioritize the backlog prioritize what the team works on based on understanding the impact outside stakeholders and to internal demands schedules priorities budgets timelines etcetera all of that rolled up as well as with my networking that already had been done in that new department new division from previous roles and from proactive networking that all just made me come out as the top candidate for that position and I was able to get that promotion and formally now become the engineering manager for the PVNV software team for crop care seating and tillage.
