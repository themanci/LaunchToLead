# Referral Program — Launch to Lead

## How It Works

1. Client finishes coaching → add them to `clients.md`
2. When ready to activate referrals → replace `[FIRST_NAME]`, `[CODE]`, and `[EXPIRATION_DATE]` in `email-template.html`
3. Copy the HTML → paste into Gmail (or send via n8n)
4. Prospect goes through the normal offer page → books a discovery call → mentions the code
5. If they sign up → pay the referrer $200
