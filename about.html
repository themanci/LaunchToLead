                        <h2>I'm Not a Career Coach Who Got Lucky Once—I'm an Engineer Who Figured Out The System</h2>
                    <p>Most career advice comes from people who either: (1) got incredibly lucky, or (2) never actually worked a day in engineering.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm neither.</p>
                    
                    <p>I earned 4 promotions in 7 years at a Fortune 100 company—not because I'm a genius, but because I figured out the patterns. What makes leadership promote you? What do they actually look for? How do you transition disciplines without starting over?</p>
                    
                    <p>This happened at a Fortune 100 industrial giant—one that employs more software engineers than many Silicon Valley firms, manages 500,000+ connected machines globally, and where failure literally impacts the global food supply.</p>
                    
                    <p>I reverse-engineered it. Then I did it again. And again. And again.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My 4 pivots:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="pivot-list">
                        <li><strong>Mechanical to Software:</strong> Test engineer analyzing engine data → Software engineer writing embedded code</li>
                        <li><strong>Individual Contributor to Agile Leadership:</strong> Software engineer → Product Owner & Scrum Master leading a team</li>
                        <li><strong>IC to People Manager:</strong> Individual contributor → Manager leading 6-10 engineers building systems and machines that operate globally across diverse applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Team Manager to Organization-Wide Lead:</strong> Team manager → Software Development Enablement Lead driving company-wide initiatives</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Now I help other engineers do the same—with the same specific frameworks, not vague platitudes.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title center">Why I Do This (It's Not Just a Side Hustle)</h2>
            <div class="why-section">
                <p>I have a full-time job I genuinely enjoy. I don't need Launch to Lead financially.</p>
                
                <p>So why do I spend nights and weekends coaching engineers?</p>
                
                <p><strong>Because I remember how lost I felt.</strong></p>
                
                <p>I remember being a mechanical engineer staring at software job postings, thinking, "I'll never break in."</p>
                
                <p>I remember being passed over for a promotion and not understanding why—just being told to "be more visible" (whatever that means).</p>
                
                <p>I remember watching peers get promoted while I stayed stuck, wondering what they knew that I didn't.</p>
                
                <p>And I remember the relief—the <em>massive</em> relief—when someone who'd been there said, "Here's exactly what you need to do."</p>
                
                <p><strong>That's what I want to give you.</strong> Not motivation. Not platitudes. Not "believe in yourself."</p>
                
                <p>I want to give you the <strong>map</strong>. The specific steps. The "if you do X, you'll likely get Y" frameworks.</p>
                
                <p>Because once I had that map, everything changed. And I think you deserve that too.</p>

    <!-- Mentorship Philosophy -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title center">I Didn't Do This Alone (And You Shouldn't Either)</h2>
            <div class="mentorship-section">
                <p class="lead-text">Let me be crystal clear about something: <strong>I did not figure all of this out by myself.</strong></p>
                
                <p class="lead-text">Every pivot I made, every promotion I earned, every mistake I avoided (or learned from)—I had mentors and coaches helping me navigate the path. Not because I was incompetent. Not because I couldn't do it alone. But because <strong>having someone who's been where you want to go is a superpower, not a crutch.</strong></p>
                
                <h3>The Mentors Who Shaped My Career</h3>
                <p>Throughout my 7 years at a Fortune 100 company, I had:</p>
                <ul class="mentorship-list">
                    <li><strong>A senior software engineer</strong> who taught me how to think like a developer when I pivoted from mechanical to software (and patiently reviewed my terrible early code)</li>
                    <li><strong>An agile coach</strong> who showed me the difference between managing tasks and leading people</li>
                    <li><strong>A director</strong> who gave me the brutal feedback I needed to hear about my communication style (and how to fix it)</li>
                    <li><strong>Peer mentors</strong> who helped me navigate politics, timing, and strategy when I was going for promotions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>I'm Still Learning (And Still Being Coached)</h3>
                <p>And here's the thing: <strong>I still have coaches and mentors today.</strong></p>
                
                <p>I have a leadership coach I meet with monthly. I have peers in other companies I bounce ideas off. I read, I listen to podcasts, I ask for feedback constantly.</p>
                
                <p>Why? Because the moment you think you've figured it all out is the moment you stop growing.</p>
                
                <h3>Coaching = Leverage, Not Weakness</h3>
                <p>Some people think getting coaching is admitting weakness. That's backwards.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Coaching is leverage.</strong> It's tapping into someone else's 10, 20, 30 years of experience and compressing their lessons into YOUR growth—without you having to make all the same mistakes.</p>
                
                <p>Think about it:</p>
                <ul class="comparison-points">
                    <li><strong>Without coaching:</strong> You try something → fail → figure out what went wrong → try again → maybe succeed. Takes 2-3 years.</li>
                    <li><strong>With coaching:</strong> You try something → get immediate feedback → adjust → succeed faster. Takes 6-12 months.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The person with a coach doesn't just move faster—they compound their advantage. After 5 years, the gap between them and the uncoached person isn't just bigger, it's exponential.</p>
                
                <h3>What You're Really Getting</h3>
                <p>You're not just getting "my advice" when you work with me. You're getting:</p>
                <ul class="value-list">
                    <li>The lessons from the 5+ mentors who shaped my career</li>
                    <li>The frameworks from the leadership coaches I've learned from</li>
                    <li>The strategies that worked (and the ones that failed spectacularly)</li>
                    <li>A decade of compressed experience you can apply immediately</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>That's not arrogance—that's the whole point of coaching. You shouldn't have to reinvent the wheel. You should learn from people who've already done it.</p>
                
                <div class="closing-thought">
                    <p><strong>So if you're thinking, "Do I really need a coach?"—here's my answer:</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>You don't NEED one. You can figure it out yourself. Many people do.</p>
                    
                    <p>But why would you want to? Why take 10 years to learn something you could master in 3? Why make all the mistakes when you could avoid 80% of them?</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Coaching isn't about dependency. It's about velocity.</strong></p>
