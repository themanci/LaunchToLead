                    <h2>I'm Not a Career Coach Who Got Lucky Once—I'm an Engineer Who Figured Out The System</h2>
                    <p>Most career advice comes from people who either: (1) got incredibly lucky, or (2) never actually worked a day in engineering.</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm neither.</p>
                    
                    <p>I earned 4 promotions in 7 years at a Fortune 100 company—not because I'm a genius, but because I figured out the patterns. What makes leadership promote you? What do they actually look for? How do you transition disciplines without starting over?</p>
                    
                    <p>This happened at a Fortune 100 industrial giant—one that employs more software engineers than many Silicon Valley firms, manages 500,000+ connected machines globally, and where failure literally impacts the global food supply.</p>
                    
                    <p>I reverse-engineered it. Then I did it again. And again. And again.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My 4 pivots:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="pivot-list">
                        <li><strong>Mechanical to Software:</strong> Test engineer analyzing engine data → Software engineer writing embedded code</li>
                        <li><strong>Individual Contributor to Agile Leadership:</strong> Software engineer → Product Owner & Scrum Master leading a team</li>
                        <li><strong>IC to People Manager:</strong> Individual contributor → Manager leading 6-10 engineers building systems and machines that operate globally across diverse applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Team Manager to Organization-Wide Lead:</strong> Team manager → Software Development Enablement Lead driving company-wide initiatives</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Now I help other engineers do the same—with the same specific frameworks, not vague platitudes.</p>
