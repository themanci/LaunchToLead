# Launch Path Documentation Backlog & Checklist

> **Created:** December 1, 2025  
> **Purpose:** Track all work needed to align Launch Method V2 and Grand Slam Offer documents, create protocols, and build bonus deliverables.

---

## Executive Summary

We have two core documents:
- **The Launch Method V2.md** – The curriculum (what we teach)
- **Launch Path Grand Slam Offer.md** – The sales & delivery package (how we sell and deliver)

These are complementary, not duplicates. This checklist tracks the work needed to align them and create all supporting materials.

**Total Estimated Effort:** 16-24 hours

## Phase 6: Decisions Needed (DO FIRST)

Before proceeding with any work, these decisions need to be made:

| # | Decision | Options | Your Choice |

3. **Phase 3** – Client Journey Protocol (maps the full picture)
4. **Phase 2** – Session Protocols (the actual delivery scripts)
5. **Phase 5** – Email Templates (support the journey)
6. **Phase 4** – Bonus PDFs (most time-consuming, do last)
