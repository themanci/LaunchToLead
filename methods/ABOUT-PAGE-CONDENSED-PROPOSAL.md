# About Page Condensed Redesign Proposal

## Current State Analysis

**Current about.html**: 754 lines  
**Current sections**: 11 sections  
**Estimated scroll time**: 3-4 minutes  
**Issue**: Too long, repetitive content, users may not read to the end

---

## Proposed Condensed Structure

### Goal
Reduce page length by 40-50% while retaining all key information and credibility signals.

---

## NEW SECTION ORDER & CONDENSING STRATEGY

### 1. Hero Section ✅ KEEP AS-IS
- Current: Simple hero with "About" heading
- **Action**: Keep unchanged

---

### 2. **"My Story" Section** → CONDENSE 60%
**Current**: 
- Long personal narrative
- Detailed childhood stories
- Multiple paragraphs

**Proposed**:
```
## Who I Am (The Real Version)

[3-4 paragraph summary instead of long narrative]

- Paragraph 1: Mechanical engineer → 4 pivots → software leader at Fortune 100
- Paragraph 2: What drives me (brief personal motivation)
- Paragraph 3: Why I coach (helping others avoid my early mistakes)

**Keep**: Authentic voice, vulnerability
**Cut**: Excessive childhood details, repetitive transitions
```

**Space Savings**: 60% reduction

---

### 3. **"Career Journey" Timeline** → CONDENSE & COMBINE WITH "What I Learned"
**Current**:
- Full 7-role timeline (2018-2025)
- Separate "What I Learned" section with 6 insight cards

**Proposed**: **Merge into "Career Highlights" Section**
```
## Career Highlights & Lessons

[Timeline format with integrated learnings]

2018-2020: Mechanical Engineer → Manufacturing Engineer
→ Key Lesson: "Coding is a tool" - Used Python/VBA to automate, not compete with CS grads

2020-2021: Manufacturing → Software Engineer (First Pivot)
→ Key Lesson: "Résumés are marketing" - Framed mechanical background as asset

2021-2023: Software → Product Owner → Technical Lead
→ Key Lesson: "Leadership before the title" - Influenced without authority

2023-2025: Tech Lead → Platform Team Lead → Enablement Lead (4 promotions)
→ Key Lesson: "Visibility is currency" - Strategic communication matters

[Stats Box]
📊 4 promotions | 4 pivots | 7 years | Fortune 100 company
```

**Space Savings**: 50% reduction (combine 2 sections into 1)

---

### 4. **"How I Coach"** Section → CONDENSE 40%
**Current**:
- Long explanations of session format, between sessions, accountability
- 3 large cards

**Proposed**: **Compact List Format**
```
## How I Actually Coach

✅ **Sessions**: 1-hour deep dives, not generic advice. We work on YOUR resume, YOUR interviews, YOUR positioning.

✅ **Between Sessions**: You'll have homework (writing STAR stories, updating LinkedIn). I'll review drafts via Slack/email.

✅ **Accountability**: You set the pace, I keep you on track. No hand-holding, no fluff.

**What makes it different**: I've been in your shoes. 4 pivots, 4 promotions. Real experience, not theory.
```

**Space Savings**: 40% reduction

---

### 5. **"Why I Do This"** Section → DELETE OR MERGE
**Current**:
- Standalone section about motivation
- Overlaps with "My Story"

**Proposed**: **Delete section, integrate into "My Story" (already done in condensed version)**

**Space Savings**: 100% deletion (content absorbed elsewhere)

---

### 6. **"Mentorship / I Didn't Do This Alone"** Section → CONDENSE 70%
**Current**:
- Long section about mentors who helped
- Multiple paragraphs about leverage

**Proposed**: **Brief Acknowledgment**
```
## Built on the Shoulders of Mentors

I didn't figure this out alone. I had mentors who gave me honest feedback, opened doors, and taught me the unwritten rules. Now I'm paying it forward.

**That's what coaching is**: leverage. What took me 7 years of trial and error, you can learn in 3 months.
```

**Space Savings**: 70% reduction

---

### 7. **"Credentials"** Section → CONDENSE 50%
**Current**:
- Education details
- Technical skills list
- Multiple paragraphs

**Proposed**: **Compact Credentials Card**
```
## Education & Expertise

🎓 **Education**
- MS & BS in Mechanical Engineering (Iowa State University)
- Machine Learning Certificate (Caltech)

💻 **Technical Background**
- Python, SQL, TypeScript, React
- Azure DevOps, Git, Agile/Scrum
- ML/Data Science fundamentals

📊 **Track Record**
- 4 promotions in 7 years (Fortune 100)
- Led teams of 50+ engineers
- Built enablement programs from scratch
```

**Space Savings**: 50% reduction

---

### 8. **"My Coaching Philosophy"** Section → CONDENSE 60%
**Current**:
- 4 pillars with explanations
- Repetitive with other sections

**Proposed**: **4 Quick Principles**
```
## Coaching Philosophy

1. **No BS**: You get honest feedback, not encouragement platitudes
2. **Tailored**: Your company, your goals, your timeline—not cookie-cutter advice
3. **Action-Oriented**: Every session ends with concrete next steps
4. **Outcome-Focused**: The goal is results (offers, pivots, promotions), not just insights
```

**Space Savings**: 60% reduction

---

### 9. **Final CTA** ✅ KEEP AS-IS
- Current: "Ready to Accelerate Your Career?" with Calendly link
- **Action**: Keep unchanged

---

## BEFORE & AFTER COMPARISON

| Section | Current Lines | Proposed Lines | Savings |
|---------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| My Story | ~180 | ~70 | 60% |
| Career Journey + What I Learned | ~200 | ~100 | 50% |
| How I Coach | ~50 | ~30 | 40% |
| Why I Do This | ~20 | 0 (merged) | 100% |
| Mentorship | ~60 | ~20 | 70% |
| Credentials | ~50 | ~25 | 50% |
| Philosophy | ~40 | ~15 | 60% |
| **TOTAL** | **~600** | **~260** | **57%** |

---

## Key Principles of Condensing

1. **Merge Overlapping Sections**: "My Story" + "Why I Do This" → Combined narrative
2. **Timeline + Lessons**: Show career progression WITH learnings inline (not separate)
3. **Cut Repetition**: Many sections reiterate "I've been there" - say it once powerfully
4. **Bulleted Lists > Paragraphs**: Faster to scan, easier to remember
5. **Stats Boxes**: Visual breaks that convey credibility quickly

---

## What We're NOT Cutting

- ✅ **Authenticity**: Voice stays personal and vulnerable
- ✅ **Credibility**: All achievements and credentials remain
- ✅ **Key Stories**: Best anecdotes stay (30% error reduction, 4 pivots)
- ✅ **Differentiation**: Still clear what makes you different from other coaches

---

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Create Full HTML Mockup
- I can build complete condensed about.html in mockups folder
- You can preview side-by-side with current version
- **Time**: ~30 minutes

### Option B: Edit Current about.html Directly
- Apply condensing principles section by section
- Easier to track changes
- **Time**: ~20 minutes

### Option C: Markdown Outline First, Then HTML
- I create detailed markdown outline with all condensed copy
- You approve
- Then I build HTML version
- **Time**: ~40 minutes total (10min outline + 30min HTML)

---

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option C**: Markdown outline → approval → HTML implementation

**Why?**
- You can review exact copy before I build HTML
- Easier to give feedback on content vs layout
- Ensures we're aligned on messaging before design work

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this proposal**: Do you agree with the condensing strategy?
2. **Choose sections to prioritize**: Any sections you want to keep longer?
3. **Choose implementation option**: A, B, or C?
4. **I'll create the condensed version** based on your feedback

---

## Quick Wins We Can Implement Immediately

Even before full redesign, we can:
1. Delete "Why I Do This" section (merge into My Story)
2. Convert "How I Coach" to bulleted list
3. Compress "Philosophy" from paragraphs to 4 one-liners
4. Merge timeline with "What I Learned" into single integrated section

**These 4 changes alone save 35% space with zero loss of information.**
