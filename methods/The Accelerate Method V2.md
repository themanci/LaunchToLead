# The Accelerate Method V2: Complete Methodology

> **Target Audience:** Mid-career engineers (3-10+ years) stuck at Individual Contributor level, seeking promotion to senior/lead/management roles.

---

## Overview

The Accelerate Method is a comprehensive framework for getting promoted faster. It addresses the reality that promotions don't go to the hardest workers—they go to people who are visible to decision-makers and have advocates in the room.

**Core Philosophy:** Performance is the prerequisite. Visibility is the multiplier. Advocacy is the accelerant.

---

# PHASE 1: THE VISIBILITY PYRAMID

We teach clients that promotion is not a reward for hard work; it is a byproduct of Influence.

---

## Level 1: The "Competence Entry Fee"

### Core Concept
Performance is not the differentiator; it is the prerequisite. Before any visibility tactics, you must be bulletproof in your core role.

### The Green Light Audit™

A self-assessment to determine if you're ready to pursue visibility tactics. Be brutally honest.

**🟢 GREEN LIGHT Indicators (You're Ready):**

| Criterion | What It Looks Like |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Role Mastery** | You can do your day-to-day job with very little help. You're not asking senior engineers "how do I do X, Y, Z?" for fundamental tasks. |
| **Go-To Status** | People come to YOU asking how to do things—not the other way around. |
| **Review Performance** | Your last yearly review was "Exceeds Expectations" or equivalent. |
| **Manager Signals** | Your manager is giving you more responsibility and praising you for above-and-beyond work. |
| **Teaching Ability** | You can train others on work tasks. |
| **Onboarding Capability** | You can onboard new team members onto the team. |
| **Presentation Ready** | You can present to others what your role does and what your team does. |

**🔴 RED LIGHT Indicators (Not Ready Yet):**

| Warning Sign | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Still Learning Fundamentals** | You're still asking senior/staff engineers about how to do basic role responsibilities. |
| **Review Below Exceeds** | Your last review was "Meets Expectations" or lower. |
| **No Increased Responsibility** | Manager isn't giving you more scope or responsibility. |
| **No Praise for Extra Work** | Manager hasn't praised you for going above and beyond. |
| **Can't Train Others** | You wouldn't be comfortable training someone on your core work. |
| **Can't Onboard** | You wouldn't be able to onboard a new teammate effectively. |

**The Rule:** If you have RED LIGHT indicators, focus on Phase 1 Level 1 first. Fix these before pursuing visibility tactics. Level 2-4 tactics are pointless if Level 1 isn't solid.

---

## Level 2: The "Skip-Level Echo"

### Core Concept
Your direct manager might be busy, incompetent, or threatened by you. You need the "Manager's Manager" (Grand-boss) to know your name and your value independently.

### The Goal
**The Bus Test:** If your direct manager got hit by a bus tomorrow, would your skip-level manager know your name and your value? If no, you are invisible.

---

### Method 1: Organic Broadcasting™

You don't brag; you "update." Strategic visibility without self-promotion.

**Tactics:**
- Volunteer to present at team meetings that include skip-level leadership
- Volunteer to give demos to stakeholders (sprint reviews, product demos, etc.)
- Write summary emails that naturally get forwarded up the chain
- Ask strategic questions in town halls that demonstrate you're thinking at a higher level

---

### Method 2: The Echo Email™

The summary email structure designed to be forwarded up the chain—or to create visibility directly.

### The Core Principles

1. **Keep it SHORT.** Managers get tons of emails. Don't make it long.
2. **Share credit with others.** The best visibility comes from recognizing others while being part of the story.
3. **Don't brag directly.** Never self-praise. Get credit through giving credit.

### Template 1: The Team Win (To Your Manager)

**When to use:** After completing something notable with teammates.

**Example:**
> **To:** Your Manager
> **CC:** Zach, Kyle (teammates who helped)
>
> Hey [Manager],
>
> Just wanted to let you know that we had a major bug come in yesterday late, and we were able to get it resolved. Wanted to give some recognition to Zach and Kyle on our team who really helped me, especially getting it tested so fast after I got the code committed.
>
> Great teamwork all around.

**Why it works:** You're sharing credit, but you're obviously part of the win. The manager sees you as both a contributor AND a team player.

---

### Template 2: The Value-Add Tool (To Your Manager)

**When to use:** When you've built something useful beyond your normal scope.

**Example:**
> **To:** Your Manager
>
> Hey [Manager],
>
> Just wanted to share that I built a new tool that can automate pulling test case reports from our Azure DevOps projects. Thought it might be useful for you when you're tracking progress on projects.
>
> I can set up a quick 1-on-1 to go over it if you're interested. Here's the link: [link]

**Why it works:** You're offering value to your manager directly. Low-key, helpful, not bragging.

---

### Template 3: The Big Team Recognition (To Skip-Level, Wide Distribution)

**When to use:** After a major team accomplishment. Goes bigger—skip-level visibility.

**Example:**
> **To:** Skip-Level Manager
> **CC:** Your Manager, Parallel Team Managers, Your Team Members, Their Team Members
>
> Hey [Skip-Level],
>
> Just wanted to take a moment to stop and recognize the team for delivering [Project X]. It was a huge effort, and so many people played a key part—especially [Name], [Name], and [Name].
>
> A lot of times, critical feedback surfaces quickly, so wanted to give a quick positive shout-out to everyone involved. Great work everyone.

**Why it works:**
- You're assumed to be part of the team (you get credit for the accomplishment)
- You're the one recognizing everyone (you get credit for leadership/maturity)
- **Double win.**

---

### What to AVOID

❌ Self-praising directly ("I did this amazing thing...")
❌ Making it long (keep it to 3-5 sentences max)
❌ Leaving out others who contributed
❌ Sending too frequently (becomes noise)

---

### Method 3: The Strategic Question Bank™

Pre-prepared questions to ask at town halls, all-hands, or leadership Q&As that get you noticed for the right reasons.

### The Goal

Demonstrate that you:
- Think strategically
- Care about the company's performance
- Are bought in to company goals
- Have done your homework

### What to AVOID

❌ **Gotcha questions** that make leadership look bad
❌ **Challenging questions** that hold their feet to the fire publicly
❌ **Tactical/small-level questions** that should go to your manager
❌ **Questions that make your manager look bad** or bypass them
❌ **"Over their head" questions** implying your manager doesn't know what's going on

**This is NOT the time to challenge senior leaders hard. That will backfire.**

### The Right Approach

Ask questions that:
- Show you've done your homework
- Show you care about company performance
- You think they'll have good answers to
- Are at THEIR level (strategy, vision, direction)

**Senior leaders are paid to think about strategy and vision. Ask about that.**

### Example Strategic Questions

**Competition & Market:**
> "I recently read that our competition is releasing [X technology]. It seems like this could be a market gap for us. Do we have plans to address this or develop our own solution so we don't lose market share?"

**Organizational Change:**
> "I know we just had a reorg in our department to improve [X]. It seems like there's been improvement, but we've also experienced some [Y consequences]. I'm trying to understand what we can do to help mitigate that—because the results on [X] are amazing and helping us so much. If we can shore up [Y] as well, we'll be golden."

**Vision & Future:**
> "Where do you see the future of [X area] for the company over the next 2-3 years?"

> "What's the biggest opportunity you see for our division that we're not fully capitalizing on yet?"

> "What keeps you up at night when you think about our competitive position?"

**Strategic Priorities:**
> "With so many initiatives happening, how do you think about prioritizing where we focus our resources?"

> "What would you say is the #1 thing that would accelerate our growth right now?"

### The Golden Rule

**You don't ask the CEO why the bathroom urinals don't work.**

Match the question to the leader's level. High-level leaders get high-level questions.

---

### Method 4: The Alignment Signal™

**The Problem:** Some employees publicly bash company leadership, goals, or initiatives in circles where it can get back to leadership.

**The Rule:** You cannot be perceived as someone who isn't bought into company direction. Even if you have concerns, there's a time and place.

**The Tactic:**
- In public forums (meetings, Slack, town halls), demonstrate genuine engagement with company initiatives
- Ask clarifying questions instead of dismissive ones
- Save critical feedback for appropriate 1-on-1 channels with your direct manager
- If you disagree with a direction, frame it as "help me understand" not "this is wrong"

**The Risk:** Word travels. If you're known as someone who bashes leadership, that reputation will reach the people who decide promotions. You'll be seen as not a team player, immature, or someone who can't be trusted with more responsibility.

**The Balance:** This doesn't mean being a yes-man. Thoughtful pushback in appropriate settings shows maturity. Public cynicism or constant negativity shows the opposite.

---

## Level 3: The "Bias Lever" (The Human Element)

### Core Concept
"People hire people, not resumes." When your name comes up in a calibration meeting, they don't picture a spreadsheet—they picture YOU. This triggers the "affinity bias" in your favor.

### The Goal
Convert "Professional Awareness" (they know your work) into "Personal Attachment" (they like you as a person and want to advocate for you).

---

### Method 1: The Value-First Connection™

**The Mindset Flip:**
Most people approach skip-levels wanting to GET from them—advice, input, advocacy, career help. You flip this by showing genuine interest in THEM and finding ways to ADD value to their lives.

**Topics That Build Connection:**
- Family (spouse, kids, parents)
- Hobbies and interests (motorcycles, reading, sports, music)
- Personal challenges you might be able to help with

**The Approach:**
- Ask genuine questions about their interests
- Listen for pain points or needs (professional OR personal)
- Look for connection points (shared interests, experiences)
- Look for ways YOU can add value to THEM

**Examples of Adding Value:**
- They're a motorcycle enthusiast, you are too → shared interest, potential riding invite
- They love a certain band, that band is playing nearby → buy them a ticket or share the info
- They like reading about X topic → you have book recommendations
- They're having issues with a property manager → you know a good one in that area and connect them
- They mention a challenge at work → you know someone with expertise who could help

**Why This Works:**
When you add value to someone's life—especially personally—they feel a sense of reciprocity. You never leverage this directly or expect tit-for-tat, but it strengthens the relationship and makes them more naturally inclined to advocate for you.

**What NOT to Do:**
- Cliché shallow questions ("What's your favorite song?")
- Making it transactional or obvious
- Expecting immediate payback
- Overdoing it to the point of seeming sycophantic

---

### Method 2: The Skip-Level Request Protocol™

**Step 1: Clear It With Your Manager First**

The Script:
> "I find it really useful to have skip-level meetings to hear about company goals, initiatives, and pain points from a higher level. And it's useful for [Skip-Level Name] to get some perspectives from closer to the ground. I wanted to run it by you first—would you be comfortable with me setting that up?"

**Critical Reassurance:**
> "You're not going to hear anything from me that would surprise you. I'm not going there to complain or drop any bombshells."

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows maturity and respect for your manager
- Builds trust (you're not going around them)
- Gets their buy-in, which may lead to them advocating for the meeting
- Sets the expectation that you'll represent the team well

**Step 2: The Outreach**

Two options (let your manager choose):
1. Manager reaches out to skip-level, CCs you
2. You reach out directly, CC your manager

Either way, the ask is simple:
> "I'd love to get some time to hear your perspective on [company direction / team challenges / specific initiative]. Would you have 15-20 minutes in the next few weeks?"

---

### Method 3: The Skip-Level Meeting Playbook™

**The Balance:** You need to weave personal AND business topics. Pure personal = you run out of things to talk about after 1-2 meetings and they regret setting it up. Pure business = you're just another meeting on their calendar.

**First Meeting Strategy:**
- Keep it MOSTLY work/project/strategy focused
- Feel them out—if they're happy chatting personally, lean into it
- Have a specific topic or question to anchor the conversation
- Share a valuable perspective from "closer to the ground"

**Ongoing Meeting Strategy:**
- Bring ideas, perspectives, or information they wouldn't otherwise have
- Make the meetings something they look forward to (you're adding value, not extracting it)
- Weave in personal topics naturally over time
- Build the relationship gradually

**What to Avoid:**
- Making every meeting about "how do I get promoted"
- Coming across as desperate to climb the ladder
- Only asking for things (advice, advocacy, help)
- Complaining about your manager

**If You Discuss Career Growth:**
Frame it as improvement, not title-chasing:
- ✅ "I know I have gaps in [area]. How would you suggest I develop there?"
- ✅ "What skills do you think differentiate people who succeed at the next level?"
- ❌ "What do I need to do to get promoted?"
- ❌ "I've been here X years, when do I get promoted?"

---

### Method 4: The Manager Amplification Tactic™

**The Concept:** When meeting with skip-level leadership, make your manager look good (assuming you have a healthy relationship).

**Why This Works:**
1. Skip-level tells your manager "I heard good things about you from [Your Name]"
2. Your manager's trust in you grows
3. Your manager feels safer giving you more exposure to other leaders
4. Skip-level sees you as mature, strategic, and trustworthy
5. Everyone wins → more exposure → more opportunity

**How to Do It:**
- Call out specific things your manager does well
- Mention improvements you've noticed
- Give credit where it's due
- No excessive ass-kissing—keep it genuine and warranted

**If Skip-Level Asks for Feedback on Your Manager:**
- Be honest, but diplomatic
- Frame constructive feedback carefully, not as complaints
- Balance any criticism with what's going well
- Never trash your manager

**The Maturity Signal:**
A mature employee raises concerns with their manager directly, not by going over their head. Skip-levels know this. If you complain about your manager to them, you look:
- Immature
- Unstrategic
- Untrustworthy
- Like a potential problem if promoted

**Exception:** If your relationship with your manager is toxic or broken, that's an HR issue, not a skip-level issue. Handle it through proper channels.

---

## Level 4: The "Genesis Protocol" (Making Roles Exist)

### Core Concept
The God Tier. You don't wait for job openings; you influence leaders to create roles—even if you don't take them yourself.

---

### Method 1: The Gap Pioneer Framework™

**The Mindset:** You're not just an order-taker executing commands. You're a builder, a pioneer who sees what the company needs before anyone asks.

**Step 1: Identify Gaps Worth Proposing**

Good gaps to propose:
- Causing real pain in the current system
- Everyone knows it's a problem
- Not fully owned by anyone
- You know of solutions from other companies/industries/departments

Bad gaps to propose:
- Pie-in-the-sky theories pulled from left field
- Problems only you see or care about
- Things that are clearly someone else's territory
- Solutions looking for problems

**Step 2: Research Solutions**
- How do other companies solve this?
- How do other departments or orgs handle it?
- What's the industry best practice?
- What's the minimum viable approach to start?

**Step 3: Volunteer to Own It**
- Pitch the problem and a proposed solution
- Offer to get things started
- Demonstrate early progress and results

**Step 4: Evolve Into a Role**
- As workload grows, discuss with manager/skip about formalizing it
- Could become a promotion for you
- Could become a new role (even if you don't take it)

**The Win-Win:**
Even if you don't get the role you created, you've established yourself as:
- A visionary who sees what the company needs
- Someone who builds, not just executes
- A leader before you have the title

This reputation leads to promotion anyway—maybe on this initiative, maybe on the next.

---

### Connection to Pivot Methodology
This follows similar principles to the Pivot Path's "Trojan Horse"—identifying problems no one owns and volunteering to solve them. The difference: Pivot uses this to change careers; Accelerate uses this to create advancement opportunities.

# PHASE 2: THE PROMOTION PROTOCOL

We teach clients that a promotion is not something you "get"; it is a new contract you negotiate by offering more value.

---

## 2.1 The Role Saturation Threshold™ (The 85% Rule)

### The Distinction from Phase 1

**Phase 1 Level 1 (Green Light Audit™)** asks: "Am I performing well? Am I self-sufficient? Am I helping others?"

**Phase 2 (Role Saturation Threshold™)** asks: "Have I extracted 85% of what this role has to offer in terms of learning, influence, impact, and improvement?"

### The Problem: Premature Asking

Some employees ask for promotion simply because:
- They've been in the role for 12 months
- They're bored and want something new
- They see peers getting promoted
- They just want more money/title

This signals immaturity and that you're focused on climbing, not adding value.

### The 85% Threshold

**The Question:** Have you tapped out your role in terms of what you can learn, influence, impact, and improve?

**Signs You're NOT at 85%:**
- There's still plenty you could do to improve your area
- You haven't mastered core aspects of the role
- You're still learning fundamental skills
- There are obvious improvements you haven't made yet
- You'd be leaving significant value on the table

**Signs You ARE at 85%:**
- You've absorbed, mastered, and benefited from most of what the role offers
- Continued growth will be slow, diminishing returns
- You're hungry for more and this role is "running dry"
- You've made the major improvements available to you
- You're ready to drink from a new firehose

### The Mindset

If you're truly focused on adding value and learning as much as you can from each role, why would you move on when you haven't absorbed 85% of what it has to offer?

After 85%, it's diminishing returns—this is the right time to start thinking about the move.

---

## 2.2 The Service-Based Ask™ (The Conversation Framework)

### The Problem: The "Greed Pitch"

Bad approaches:
- "I want more money"
- "I want a promotion"
- "I've been here X years, I deserve this"
- "My peers got promoted, why not me?"

### The Reframe: Impact Over Title

You frame it as a desire for:
- More responsibility
- Greater impact
- Bigger problems to solve
- Continued growth (because current role is running dry)

**Ban the word "Promotion" from the initial conversation.**

---

### Method 1: The Optimal Timing Strategy™

**Best Time: Annual Review (with "Exceeds Expectations")**

Why this is ideal:
- Your manager has already admitted you're performing at a high level
- You likely have evidence of hitting the 85% threshold
- Role, performance, future, and potential are already on the table
- It's the most appropriate venue for this discussion

**Alternative: Dedicated 1-on-1**

If not annual review, schedule a specific 1-on-1 for this purpose.

**The One-Month Notice Rule:**
Give your manager at least one month notice that you want to discuss your future in an upcoming 1-on-1.

Why:
- Not a good topic to spring with no warning
- Gives manager time to think, gather feedback, prepare
- Shows forethought and maturity on your part
- Signals you want serious feedback and a serious discussion
- Gives YOU time to prepare properly

**What NOT to do:**
- Bring it up casually in passing
- Spring it on them unexpectedly
- Mention it repeatedly as a sidenote (becomes unserious)

**Timing to Avoid:**
- Mid-project (unless project is 2-5 years and you can't wait)
- If you're less than a year from delivering a major project, focus on that first
- Finishing strong shows maturity and seriousness

---

### Method 2: The Evidence Arsenal™

**Come Prepared With:**

1. **360 Feedback** - Positive feedback from your ecosystem (peers, seniors, direct reports) that speaks well of you

2. **Performance Reviews** - Your yearly reviews showing strong performance

3. **Accomplishments List** - Documented impacts you've had, problems solved, value added

4. **Role Saturation Evidence** - Be prepared to explain why/how the role doesn't have much more juice to squeeze

**The Frame:**
You're not just asking for a promotion—you're demonstrating that you're hungry and eager to drink from the firehose, and this one is running dry.

---

### Method 3: The Service-Based Script Library™

**The Core Script:**
> "I feel I've mastered my current scope. I'm looking for more responsibility so I can solve [Bigger Problem] for the team. What does the gap between my current output and that level look like?"

**Annual Review Context:**
> "Thank you for the feedback on my performance this year. Based on what we've discussed, I feel I've gotten to a place where I've absorbed most of what this role has to offer. I'm hungry to take on more responsibility and continue growing. Can we talk about what the path to the next level looks like?"

**Scheduled 1-on-1 Context:**
> "As I mentioned last month, I wanted to use this time to discuss my future growth. I've put together some thoughts on what I've accomplished and where I see myself contributing at a higher level. I'd love your feedback on what gaps I need to close."

### The Guiding Principles

Every script we develop with clients follows these principles:

1. **Respectful** — Always professional, never confrontational
2. **Empathetic** — Acknowledge their position and constraints
3. **Professional** — Keep emotions in check
4. **Fact-Seeking** — Push for tangible, actionable feedback
5. **Accountability-Creating** — Make it hard for them to give vague, non-actionable responses

### Custom Script Development

It's impossible to imagine every scenario. We work with clients to develop scripts for their specific situations, challenges, and manager dynamics.

**The goal is always the same:** Get specific, actionable feedback that you can work on—and that holds them accountable to evaluate you fairly when you deliver.

---

## 2.3 The Objection Playbook™

### Objection 1: "We're not doing promotions right now"

**Response:**
> "I understand there are constraints right now. Can you give me a date or timeframe when we can revisit this after those constraints are removed?"

**Why This Works:**
- Holds them accountable
- Prevents indefinite delays
- Gives you a concrete checkpoint
- If they still won't open the door at that time, you have information for your next decision

---

### Objection 2: "You're doing great, keep it up"

**Response:**
> "Thanks for the positive feedback! Can you be more specific about what I'm doing great at? And what other things would I need to be doing great at 6 months from now to have this discussion again? I'd love any specific feedback or areas to work on and improve."

**Why This Works:**
- Converts vague praise into actionable items
- Forces specificity
- Creates a timeline for follow-up

---

### Objection 3: "You're not ready yet"

**Response:**
> "I appreciate the honesty. Can we go into more detail about what would make me ready? What specific things can I work on and improve over the next 6-12 months so that I would be ready?"

**Follow-Up Actions:**
- Get specifics documented
- Set a date for the next check-in
- Provide monthly updates on progress toward those goals
- Bring evidence of improvement

---

### Objection 4: "I don't control that, it's HR/leadership"

**Response:**
> "Good to know. If I pursue an opportunity with HR or leadership, do I have your support? If they reached out to you about your opinion, would you be in my corner?"

**If Yes:** Great, you have an ally.

**If No/Hesitant:** Refer back to "You're not ready yet" approach—get specifics on what would earn their support.

---

### Objection 5: "Let's revisit this at annual review"

**Response:**
> "Sounds good. Can you give me specifics I can work on between now and then? I'd like to have a picture of what I'd need to accomplish, fix, or improve—or what level I'd need to be at—so I know I'm working towards tangible, achievable goals. I understand a promotion isn't guaranteed, but it would be helpful to have actionable things to focus on."

---

## 2.4 The Gap Analysis Contract™

### The Concept

Get your manager to articulate specific gaps you need to close to be considered for promotion.

### The Approach: Collaborative, Not Pushy

**What NOT to Do:**
- "If I do this, you better give me that promotion"
- Act entitled or demanding
- Make them feel boxed in
- Push so hard they make the list impossible to discourage you

**The Right Frame:**
> "I know this isn't a guarantee—I'm not asking for a checklist that automatically gets me promoted. I'm asking for your guidance on my weaknesses and gaps so I can be a serious contender in the future. I want to focus on adding value and growing, and I need your experience and knowledge to help me get there."

### Tracking the Agreement

Where to track:
- Company's yearly goals tracking system
- Individual Development Plan (IDP) system
- Your personal OneNote/documentation

**The Key:** Get agreement on the list with your manager. Have them detail what they need to see from you to view you at the next level.

### Monthly Check-Ins

- Review progress on the agreed items in monthly 1-on-1s
- Have something to show each month (demonstrates seriousness)
- Blow their socks off at the first few check-ins

**What NOT to Do:**
- Bring up "promotion" every month
- Hound them repeatedly (most annoying thing for a manager)
- Celebrate crossing off every single item

**What TO Do:**
- Update them on initiative progress
- Wait until the list is mostly complete before raising promotion again
- When you do raise it, have evidence ready

### If Manager Won't Commit to Specifics

1. **Understand why** - Is there a legitimate reason?

2. **Consider bringing it up in skip-level** (tactfully):
   > "I asked my manager to help identify gaps I can improve to demonstrate I'm at the next level, and we didn't land on specifics. Do you have anything you could give me as tangible targets to work towards?"

3. **Play it cool when manager follows up:**
   > "After our discussion, I didn't have anything concrete to work on, so when I had the skip-level I thought I'd pick their brain about it from a higher level. I'm hoping you can help me boil those down into actionable things. I'm really looking for your experience and guidance here."

**Critical:** Never be aggressive or threatening. Be tactful. Don't push too hard.

### The Moving Goalpost Problem

**Red Flag:** You complete the agreed list, they give you a new list. You complete that, they give you a third list.

**What This Means:** You likely have a toxic manager who may string you along for years.

**Action:**
- If it's genuinely budget or company constraints, that's legitimate—wait it out
- If it's your manager stringing you along, develop an exit strategy
- Look for internal moves to other divisions/departments
- If that's not possible, look externally

---

## 2.5 The Continuous Campaign™

### The Problem: The Annual Review Lottery

Most people wait for HR cycles and hope their name comes up. This is passive and ineffective.

### The Cadence

**Monthly:** Update your manager on progress toward agreed initiatives. Don't mention promotion—just demonstrate progress.

**Quarterly/When List is Complete:** Re-raise the promotion conversation with evidence that you've completed most of the agreed items.

### The Balance

**Too Frequent = Annoying**
- Don't hound them about promotion monthly
- Don't celebrate every item crossed off
- Don't seem desperate or pushy

**Too Infrequent = Forgotten**
- Don't wait years between conversations
- Don't let momentum die
- Don't assume they're tracking your progress

### When They Say "You're Still Not Ready"

If you've mostly completed the list:
1. Present the evidence of completion
2. Ask what other items they think are necessary
3. Keep putting it back on them to give specific reasons
4. Be persistent, not whiney or annoying

---

## 2.6 Timeline & Exit Strategy

### How Long Does This Take?

**There is no set timeline.** The focus is on positioning, not time.

You're ready when:
- You're an expert at your job (Phase 1, Level 1)
- People come to you for help
- You've squeezed 85% of the juice from the role (Phase 2)
- You're having impact outside your role
- You've built relationships and advocates

**Examples:**
- Someone 3 years in a role might close gaps in 6 months
- Someone 2 years in might need 18 months
- The closer you follow the process and track it, the faster you get there

### When to Look Externally

**Start planning an exit when:**
- Manager refuses to give concrete improvement items
- Manager is dragging feet and clearly not in your corner
- You've completed the agreed list twice and they propose a third
- Your manager is stringing you along
- It's not easy at your company to get promoted without your direct manager's support

**Options:**
1. **Internal transfer** - Apply to other divisions, departments, teams
2. **External opportunities** - Start looking at other companies

**Note:** Internal moves may be harder without manager support, but not impossible. Your skip-level relationships and reputation can help.

### Internal vs. External Promotion

**Internal Promotion:**
- Visibility and relationships play a key role
- Everything in this methodology directly applies
- Manager support often critical

**External Promotion (New Company):**
- Your visibility and relationships become references
- Strong relationships can vouch for you
- You may need to rebuild visibility at the new company

## 2.7 The Promotion Positioning Philosophy™

### The Core Insight

The promotion conversation shouldn't be one giant, high-stakes conversation.

**We are NOT pursuing:** Some salesman tactic where you play 3D chess with your manager to convince them to say "yes" in a single moment.

**We ARE pursuing:** Slowly painting yourself as the obvious candidate. Gradually tipping the balance in your favor. Building so much evidence that people feel dumb for even questioning whether you deserve a promotion.

### The 600-Pound Gorilla Strategy

Your goal is to build a body of work and evidence that becomes **so overwhelming** it's the 600-pound gorilla in the room.

It can't be ignored. If it IS ignored, it's just ridiculous.

### The Shift

From: "How do I convince them in a conversation?"
To: "How do I make it undeniable over time?"

---

## 2.8 The Promotion Binder™

### What It Is

A private resource YOU keep to build your case. Evidence of:
- What you've done
- Impact you've had
- Value you've added
- Feedback received
- Metrics improved
- Problems solved

### How to Use It

**Primary Use:** Personal tracking.
- Know what you're doing
- Know if you're on track
- Build the mountain of evidence

**Keep it available to yourself at all times** to measure your progress toward an undeniable case.

### When to Bring It Out

**Generally: DON'T bring this to meetings.**

Bringing a binder of accomplishments early makes you look:
- Petty
- Like you're "counting points"
- Transactional

**You don't want to tally the score. You want to build a mountain of evidence that gets undeniable.**

### The Exception

**Last resort only:** If your manager has strung you along twice already about "what to do to be considered" and still refuses to consider you or put you up for promotion.

In this case, having documented evidence can be useful—but this is an entrenched situation, not a normal promotion conversation.

---

## 2.9 The Compensation Negotiation at Promotion™

### The Reality Check

Some companies use a formula. You take it or leave it. No negotiation possible.

If you're NOT in that scenario, read on.

### The Empowerment Principle

**By getting the offer, you are empowered.**

They chose YOU. You are the candidate they want. By default, you have leverage.

If they want you, you have something of value. **Don't sell yourself short.**

### The Fear to Abandon

Never think that negotiating will make you look greedy or hurt you.

**The worst that can happen:** They say no, and you take it or leave it.

Always try to get what you believe you're worth.

### The Preparation

1. **Get data from other companies** about what that role/level is worth
2. **Ask colleagues** if they're willing to share
3. **Use open-source salary data** (levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Blind, etc.)
4. **Do your homework** before the conversation

### The Tactic

**Go big first. Negotiate down.**

If you ask for less than you want, you leave money on the table. Start high, be willing to meet in the middle.

### Our Focus at LaunchToLead

Our primary focus is getting you the promotion first. Once you have an offer, we can work with you on negotiation tactics for your specific situation.

# PHASE 3: THE STRATEGIC EXPANSION

We teach clients how to expand their territory without losing their fortress.

---

## 3.1 The "Not My Job" Funeral™

### The Mindset Shift

Eliminate "That's not my job" from your vocabulary.

**Replace with:** "The Team Success Metric" — If the team fails, you fail. If the team succeeds, you have a claim to that success.

### The Tactic

When gaps appear (project stalling, work falling through cracks), step in. Not as a servant, but as a **Stabilizer**.

### The Key Distinction

You're not blindly taking on any work that comes your way. You're strategically identifying opportunities that:
- Add real value
- Give you visibility
- Demonstrate leadership before you have the title

---

## 3.2 The Opportunity Filter™

### The Problem

Not all extra work is created equal. Some opportunities accelerate your career. Others bury you with no credit.

### The Evaluation Criteria

**Before taking on extra work, ask:**

1. **Is this value-added work?**
   - Is it tracked in your team's backlog or sprint planning?
   - Is it an actual priority with real deliverables?
   - Or is it someone's pet project that isn't going anywhere?

2. **Will this be visible?**
   - Can you make your manager and others aware you're doing this?
   - Will there be opportunities to give updates and report-outs?
   - Or will this disappear into a black hole?

3. **Can you actually deliver?**
   - Do you have the capacity to do this well?
   - Or will this cause your core work to slip?

### Red Flags to Avoid

🚩 **Project not tracked in team's official work** — Signals it's not a real priority

🚩 **Project ongoing for a long time with no progress** — Signals no one cares or expects delivery

🚩 **Project with unclear or low value** — You'll put in effort with little payoff

🚩 **Manager's pet project with no organizational buy-in** — You become attached to something that may never matter

**The Rule:** Don't be the first to volunteer for low-value work. Let someone else get bogged down by it.

### Making It Visible

When you DO take on good extra work:
- Make sure your manager knows
- Give updates and report-outs to team/manager/skip-level
- Don't take it on in silence

**You have a big hand in making your work visible or invisible.** Choose visibility.

### The "What Should I Deprioritize?" Trap

**Don't always respond with:** "What should I deprioritize if I'm taking this on?"

This can come off as complaining or dodging work.

**Only have this conversation when:** The work is literally too much and you WILL miss deadlines no matter what.

**Otherwise:** Agree to take it on (if it passes the filter), but don't do it invisibly.

---

## 3.3 The Quality Firewall™ (The Safety Mechanism)

### The Problem

Ambition leading to mediocrity. Taking on 120% workload and delivering 80% quality on everything.

### The Rule

**"Core First, Expansion Second."**

Only take on extra scope if your core performance remains at an "A" level.

### The Stop Sign

A drop in core performance is your signal to immediately drop extra scope.

**The Career Death Spiral:** Being a "weak performer with a lot of tasks" is worse than being a solid performer with normal scope. This kills careers.

---

### Method 1: The Early Warning System™

**Don't wait until things slip.** Recognize warning signs early:

- You're working significantly more hours than sustainable
- You're cutting corners on core deliverables
- You're missing small deadlines or commitments
- Quality of your work is declining
- You're feeling overwhelmed or stressed
- You're not preparing adequately for meetings

**When you see these signs:** It's time to have a conversation BEFORE things actually slip.

---

### Method 2: The Bad News Early Protocol™

**A hallmark of promotion-ready engineers:** Delivering bad news fast and early.

**The Principle:** Telling your manager as soon as you think a project is at risk is a GOOD thing. It signals you can identify risk early and adjust.

**If this makes your manager mad:** You have a bad manager. Good managers appreciate early warning.

**How to Deliver Bad News:**

1. **Come prepared with context:**
   > "This is taking more than expected. Scope has widened. We've hit some snags causing delays. It's clear we need more resources."

2. **Come with proposed solutions (never just problems):**
   > "I think if I get help from [person], or if we reprioritize these 3 projects, or if we extend this deadline and shuffle things around, we can still deliver."

**Never say:** "We can't deliver" and stop there.

**Always say:** "We can't deliver, BUT here are some options..."

**Even if your solutions aren't perfect or don't get picked, come with something.** Coming with a problem and no proposed solution is amateur hour.

---

### Method 3: The Collaborative Problem-Solving Approach™

When you deliver bad news with proposed solutions, you're now **collaborating** with your manager to solve a problem you didn't directly cause.

**This leads to:**
- Manager helping you reprioritize
- Manager getting you more resources
- Manager extending deadlines on other things
- A healthy, synced-up relationship

**No risk of "burning bridges"** because you're working together, not dumping problems on them.

**Prerequisites:**
- Good, healthy relationship with manager
- Regular status reports and checkpoints
- Maturity to deliver bad news early
- Always bringing solutions with problems

---

## 3.4 The Scope Beacon™ (Visibility for Extra Work)

### The Problem

"Silent Martyrs" — People who do extra work hoping the boss will notice their sacrifice. They rarely do.

### The Principle

You don't just "do" extra work; you **communicate** it. Couple the work with awareness.

### Example 1: The Crisis Fix
> "I noticed the database was lagging, so I jumped in and optimized the index to ensure the team hits the Friday deadline."

**Signals:** I saw a problem → I took ownership → I saved the team

### Example 2: The Tool Builder
You used AI to build a tool that automates something (in extra time or outside work).

**The Beacon:**
- Tell your manager about it
- Ask if you can share at the next employee meeting or lunch-and-learn
- Demo it to the team

### Example 3: The Knowledge Sharer
You took a training and acquired new skills or knowledge.

**The Beacon:**
- Ask your manager's permission to share with the team
- Present at a team meeting or lunch-and-learn
- Write it up for the team wiki

### Example 4: The Cross-Functional Helper
You got involved in a project for another team and added value.

**The Beacon:**
- Let your manager know (ahead of time for large scope, after for small)
- Ask if you can share the experience with your team
- Present learnings or outcomes

---

### Scope Beacon Channels

Multiple ways to create visibility:

| Channel | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **1-on-1 with manager** | Always — they'll often tell others |
| **Team meeting mention** | Quick updates, small wins |
| **Demo to team** | Tools, technical solutions |
| **Lunch-and-learn** | Knowledge sharing, training takeaways |
| **Recognition email** | See "The Recognition Boomerang" below |

---

### Method: The Recognition Boomerang™

One of the most powerful visibility tactics.

**How It Works:**
1. Work on a project with others (even outside your core team)
2. When it's complete, send a recognition email to a large group
3. Thank and congratulate everyone else on the project for their accomplishment
4. CC your manager

**Why It Works:**
- You're highlighting OTHERS for great work (generous, not self-promoting)
- But by initiating the email, you reveal your own involvement
- Your manager sees you're contributing beyond core scope
- You look like a team player and leader

**Reality:** Some of the best recognition you'll ever get comes on the back of recognizing others.

---

## 3.5 The Cross-Functional Expansion Protocol™

### The Opportunity

Cross-functional projects (tiger teams, task forces, initiatives outside your team) provide visibility across the organization.

### How These Arise

These opportunities come because:
- You've built a strong network
- You've become a go-to person who knows things
- People want your expertise

### The Same Rules Apply

Apply everything from internal expansion, but now to external teams:

1. **Opportunity Filter** — Is this valuable, visible, achievable?
2. **Quality Firewall** — Don't let it hurt your core performance
3. **Scope Beacon** — Make sure your manager knows and give updates
4. **Silent Martyr Prevention** — Don't do tons of work invisibly for other teams

### Additional Caution: The Finish Factor

**Be very careful:** When you volunteer to help outside teams, you MUST:
- Do a good job
- Follow through to completion
- Not disappear halfway or fizzle out

**The Risk:** Your external-facing reputation becomes "he starts but doesn't finish." This is career poison.

### Manager Alignment

Your manager may have a backlog of things they consider higher priority than cross-functional work. Always:
- Keep them informed
- Get their buy-in for larger commitments
- Balance external work with internal priorities

---

## 3.6 The Support Role Entry™

### The Problem

When you step into someone else's project or area, you risk:
- Stepping on toes
- Being seen as a glory-seeker
- Undermining others
- Making people defensive

### The Solution: Always Enter as Support

**Scripts for entering:**
- "Is there any way I can help support?"
- "Can I add any value here?"
- "Anything I can help take some workload off of?"

**Always frame yourself as:** Support role, not decision-maker.

### Building Social Credit

When you enter humbly as support:
1. People accept you (you're helping, not threatening)
2. You defer to those who've been there longer
3. You build trust through humility
4. Eventually, people WANT your input

**The Progression:**
- Early: "I'm pretty new to this project. I'd have to defer to you guys who've been on this much longer and know the details. I'm just here to help."
- Later: Others say "No, it's okay, we really want your input."
- Finally: You can weigh in with a still-humble attitude, adding value without stepping on toes.

### What NOT to Do

❌ Come in wanting to take over
❌ Start making decisions immediately
❌ Act like you know better than people already on the project
❌ Undermine the existing leadership

---

## 3.7 The Strategic No™

### The Problem

You can't say yes to everything. But saying "no" wrong makes you look like you're not a team player.

### The Principle

Never just say "no, I'm busy." Show enthusiasm while acknowledging constraints.

### The Script

> "I would absolutely love to get involved in that and help out—I think it has a ton of value. But I just have too much on my plate right now."

### Follow-Up Options

**Option 1: Offer a future timeline**
> "If I had some capacity after [X time], would I still be able to join the project and pitch in?"

**Option 2: Test the priority**
> "Do you think this is more value-added and higher priority than everything I currently have on my plate?"

If yes → Talk to your manager about reprioritizing
If no → You've established it can wait

**Option 3: Suggest a delay**
> "Could we delay this until I'm free so I can work on it properly?"

**The Flush-Out:** If they say "yeah, it can wait 3 months," then it's not really high priority. You've dodged low-value work gracefully.

### What This Accomplishes

- You don't look like you're dodging work
- You show enthusiasm for the opportunity
- You acknowledge constraints honestly
- You create options for future involvement
- You test whether it's actually high priority

# PHASE 4: THE REPUTATION WILDFIRE

We teach clients how to build a reputation that enters the room before they do.

---

## 4.1 The Gravity Audit™

### The Problem

Not all senior leaders are created equal. Some are loud but lack real influence. Others quietly set the direction of the entire organization.

**The Mistake:** Sucking up to the wrong people—the loudest manager instead of the most respected one.

### The Concept: Gravity Leaders

Gravity Leaders are the people who set the vision. When they speak, it translates into action. Other leaders look to them. Their influence extends beyond their org chart position.

### How to Identify Gravity Leaders

**Ask yourself these questions:**

1. **Who sets the vision?**
   - Whose speeches translate into actual goals and initiatives?
   - Who are the real thinkers at your company or department?

2. **Who has cross-functional respect?**
   - Who do leaders in OTHER departments and divisions look up to?
   - Who gets mentioned admiringly in cross-functional settings?

3. **Who has a track record?**
   - Who has led major initiatives that actually succeeded?
   - Who has a history of delivering results?

4. **Who has organic admiration?**
   - Who do people speak highly of at the lunch table, 2 levels down?
   - Who are the managers that people WISH their manager was like?
   - Who are the leaders whose skip-level reports tell you they're amazing?

5. **Who inspires you?**
   - Who are the people at high levels you feel happy are there?
   - Who do you wish you could be more like?

### The Signals

All of these point to leaders who are:
- Influential
- Liked
- Impactful
- Visionary
- Forward-thinking

**These are the people to build relationships with. These are the wagons to hitch yours to.**

---

## 4.2 The Cross-Functional Bridge Builder™

### The Opportunity

Engineering work naturally involves cross-functional teams: design, software, testing, product owners, program managers, factory, etc.

**This is a golden opportunity** to build relationships outside your immediate org.

### The Mistake

Being the person who only speaks up when your little part comes up, then zones out for the rest.

### The Tactic: Active Cross-Functional Engagement

**Before meetings:**
- Reach out to cross-functional team members to align on messaging
- See if you have similar perspectives to present together

**During meetings:**
- Engage with topics beyond just your piece
- Ask thoughtful questions about other functions
- Offer help or perspective where relevant

**After meetings:**
- Reach out to cross-functional people individually
- Ask if what you presented made sense or aligns with their needs
- See if there's something you can help with

### The Progression: Peer to Manager

**Step 1: Build peer relationships**
Start with people at your level in other functions. Work on projects together. Build trust.

**Step 2: Learn about their managers**
Ask your cross-functional peers about their managers. Identify which ones are Gravity Leaders worth knowing.

**Step 3: Get your foot in the door**
Once you have strong relationships with 2+ people who report to a target manager:

> "Hey, I've been working on [Project X] with [Person A] and [Person B] who report to you, and we've been doing some amazing work together. I was wondering if we could set up some time to chat about [specific topic]."

**Step 4: Continue climbing**
That manager might attend higher-level status meetings. Find connection points there. Keep looking for loose strings you can grab onto and climb.

### The Key Insight

You're building a network that extends beyond your direct org. Every cross-functional relationship is a potential bridge to new visibility and new advocates.

---

## 4.3 The Business Value Principle™

### The Balance

Personal interaction is good, necessary, and key. But if it's ALL personal, you're just an acquaintance, not a professional asset.

### The Rule

You need to be seen as someone who **brings value to the business**.

### The Tactic

Try to get involved in projects and business value-added activities that have visibility to cross-org areas.

**Best activities for cross-functional visibility:**
- Cross-functional project teams
- Company-wide initiatives
- Process improvement efforts that span orgs
- Task forces and tiger teams
- Presenting at cross-org meetings

**Personal relationship builds ON TOP of business value, not instead of it.**

---

## 4.4 The Reference Nudge™ (Internal & External)

### The Problem

Asking a leader to "go put in a good word for me" is:
- Weak
- Desperate
- Puts them in an awkward position
- May burn their social credit
- Can make interview teams think you're seeking preferential treatment

### The Solution: Let Them Be Discovered

Instead of asking people to advocate for you directly, **make them available** for the hiring/promotion team to discover.

### The Script (In Thank-You Email)

> "Thank you again for your time discussing the [role]. If it would help to get a clearer picture of my past performance and working style, here are some people I've worked with who could share their perspective:
> 
> - [Name, Title, Relationship context]
> - [Name, Title, Relationship context]
> - [Name, Title, Relationship context]"

### Why This Works

- The solicitation comes FROM the interview/hiring team, not from you
- You're not asking anyone to "put in a good word"
- The interview team can reach out to whoever they want
- It looks confident, not desperate

### Prerequisites

1. **Clear it with them first** — Make sure each person is okay being listed
2. **They actually worked with you** — Professional/business context, not just personal friendship
3. **They would speak highly of you** — Strong relationships only

### Application to Internal Moves

This works for internal job applications too:
- Include references in your thank-you to the interview panel
- Same principle: let them be discovered, don't ask for direct advocacy

### Reference Selection for External Moves

**Be careful when listing current employer references for external roles:**

- Only use elite-level contacts who won't sell you out
- Must be strong relationships with a solid personal element
- Must be people who truly respect you and would speak highly
- If you don't care about staying at your current company, you can be more risk-taking
- If you have contacts who carry weight at the target company, even better

---

## 4.5 The Wildfire Detection™

### How Do You Know Your Reputation Precedes You?

**Signal 1: High yearly ratings that persist**
- Managers up the chain have to approve these ratings
- Hearing your name mentioned repeatedly in this context builds an aura
- You become known as a high performer

**Signal 2: Direct feedback**
- People start telling you directly that you have a good reputation
- You hear that others speak well of you

**Signal 3: Retention conversations**
- Your manager or other managers start asking:
  - "What are your goals?"
  - "What would keep you engaged?"
  - "Are you interested in your work?"
  - "What would interest you more?"
- These are signals they're trying to gauge if you'll stick around
- They're worried about losing you

**Signal 4: The "don't leave" vibe**
- If you sense your manager and their leadership don't want you to leave the company, you're a high performer
- Top-tier companies identify top performers and try to challenge, reward, and keep them engaged
- If your company doesn't do this, consider looking for one that does

---

## 4.6 The Wildfire Maintenance Protocol™

### How to Keep the Fire Burning

**1. Keep delivery high**
Continue doing excellent work. The wildfire is fueled by results.

**2. Spread credit generously**
When recognition comes to you, share it with others. This makes people want to work with you and advocate for you.

**3. Stay humble**
Know you always have more to learn. Arrogance kills reputations fast.

**4. Keep a growth mindset**
Always look for ways to improve. Complacency kills the wildfire.

**5. Give more than you get**
Continue adding value to others. Be known as someone who contributes, not just extracts.

### Wildfire Killers

🔥❌ **Complacency** — Coasting on past success

🔥❌ **Arrogance** — Acting like you've "made it"

🔥❌ **Taking without giving** — Only extracting value from relationships

🔥❌ **Resting on reputation** — Assuming the wildfire sustains itself

🔥❌ **Quality drops** — Letting your work product decline

---

## 4.7 The Reputation Recovery Protocol™

### The Hard Truth

**It takes far longer to restore a reputation than to destroy it.**

Human psychology means many people simply will not let it go. A bad reputation is hard to escape.

### Assessment: How Bad Is the Damage?

**Consider:**
1. **What happened?** — Size and nature of the slip-up
2. **Who knows?** — Which audience was affected?
3. **Are they gatekeepers?** — Did influential leaders and decision-makers see it?

### Recovery Paths by Severity

**Minor Slip-Up:**
- Dedicate yourself to the principles in this methodology
- People do change and improve
- Consistent excellent performance over time can rebuild trust

**Medium Slip-Up:**
- Consider a new department or division within the company
- A fresh start in a new area can be a reset/refresh
- Your reputation in the old area may be damaged, but the new area is a clean slate

**Major Slip-Up:**
- If influential leaders and gatekeepers were affected, this is serious
- You may never recover in a reasonable timeframe at this company
- Seriously assess whether moving to a new company is the right path
- A new company = complete reputation reset

### The Key Factor

**Who was affected matters more than what happened.**

- Damaged reputation with non-influential people = not ideal, but recoverable
- Damaged reputation with Gravity Leaders and gatekeepers = major issue requiring serious reassessment

---

## 4.8 The External Reputation Builder™

### Why External Reputation Matters

Your internal reputation can translate to external opportunities. Building visibility outside your company opens doors you can't see yet.

### Tactics for External Visibility

**1. Present at industry events**
- Tech expos, conferences, seminars
- Positions you as a thought leader
- Creates connections outside your company bubble

**2. Actually network at events**
- When you attend conferences or trainings, meet new people
- Don't just stick with your company colleagues
- Step outside your comfort zone

**3. Be active on professional platforms**
- LinkedIn is the obvious one
- Share insights, engage with industry content
- Build a professional brand beyond your employer

**4. Engage with visiting speakers/trainers**
- When external experts come to your company, get to know them
- Make sure they know you
- These people have networks across the industry

**5. Leverage joint projects**
- If you collaborate with other companies, build relationships with that team
- These cross-company connections are valuable

**6. Build vendor relationships**
- Get to know your 3rd party vendors as people, not just service providers
- They interact with many companies and can be part of your network

**7. Participate in recruiting**
- If your company offers recruiting opportunities, take them
- You'll meet recruiters from other companies
- Great way to build external network

### The Principle

Find any way to interact professionally with people outside your company. Build business relationships first, then layer personal relationships on top.

# PHASE 5: THE SOFT SKILLS ENGINE

We teach clients that technical skills get you in the door, but soft skills determine how high you climb.

**The Core Truth:** Most engineers hit a ceiling not because they lack technical ability, but because they can't navigate the human dynamics of organizations. This is THE bottleneck for promotion.

---

## 5.1 The Audience Awareness Principle™

### The Master Key

**Everything in soft skills comes back to one question: Who is your audience?**

This is the foundation of all communication, influence, and executive presence. Before you speak, write, or act, ask:

1. **Who am I communicating with?**
2. **What do they care about?**
3. **What do they need to know?**
4. **What's the best way to deliver this to THEM?**

### The Audience Mismatch Problem

**The Pattern:** Engineers communicate the same way to everyone—their VP, their scrum master, a new hire, a cross-functional stakeholder. This is career-limiting.

**Examples of Audience Mismatch:**
- A senior engineer presenting technical risk to leadership uses jargon that's foreign to non-technical executives
- A senior explaining something to a new hire goes way over their head
- An IC sends the same level of detail to their skip-level as to their peer

### The Audience Calibration

| Audience | What They Care About | Communication Style |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Senior Leadership** | Business impact, decisions needed, risks | Ultra-concise, bottom-line up front |
| **Your Manager** | Progress, blockers, what they need to know | Regular, no surprises, clear asks |
| **Peers** | Collaboration, shared goals, mutual help | Collaborative, detailed when needed |
| **New Team Members** | Learning, context, not being overwhelmed | Patient, foundational, check understanding |
| **Cross-Functional** | Their priorities, how you impact them | Translate to their language |

**The Rule:** Adjust your communication to the person you're talking to, not to what's comfortable for you.

---

## 5.2 The Written Communication Protocol™

### The Modern Landscape

**Get with the times.** The workforce is younger and communication preferences have shifted.

| Medium | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **IM/Chat (Slack, Teams)** | Fast, critical information flow. Quick questions. Real-time coordination. |
| **Email** | Important, needs documentation. Official announcements. Things that need to be referenced later. More "permanent" feel. |
| **Document/Wiki** | Detailed information that many people need to reference over time. |

### The Email Hierarchy Rule

**The higher up the ladder, the more your email must be:**
- Serious
- Concise
- Value-dense per square inch

**Why:** Senior leaders get 100+ emails a day. They're busier than you. If your email requires them to scroll, you've already lost them.

### The Conciseness Commandment

**The #1 written communication mistake:** Emails that are too long.

**The Problem:**
- You're emotionally invested in the details
- You want to show your work
- You fear leaving something out

**The Reality:**
- The recipient doesn't need all that detail
- Long emails get skimmed or ignored
- You come across as unable to prioritize

### The TL;DR Structure™

For those who fear leaving out detail but need to be concise:

**Top of Email:** The main gravy—the key points, the ask, the bottom line

**Below:** "See more detail below" → then include the supporting detail

**This way:**
- Busy readers get what they need in 5 seconds
- Those who want detail can scroll
- You've covered your bases without burying the lead

### The CC Discipline

**Before adding someone to CC, ask:**
- Why am I including this person?
- What do I hope they get from this?
- What value can they add?

**The Risk:** If you become known as someone who CCs everyone on everything, you become **noise**. People start ignoring your emails. When you actually need their attention, you won't get it.

**The Rule:** Every CC should have a purpose. Don't spam inboxes.

### The No-Fluff Principle

**For business communication to senior leaders:**
- Skip the long personal intro
- Get to the POINT
- Respect their time
- Value per real estate should be high

**There's a time for "Hey, how was your weekend?"—but that's 1-on-1s and relationship building, not status emails to VPs.**

### Knowing Their Preferences

**Different people prefer different communication channels.** Learn what works for each key person:
- Some managers prefer Slack for quick updates
- Some executives prefer email for anything important
- Some people hate meetings and want everything in writing

**Cater to what works best for THEM, not what's easiest for you.**

## 5.3 The Verbal Communication Protocol™

### The Audience Adjustment (Verbal Edition)

Same principle, applied to speaking:

**Before presenting or speaking, ask:**
- Who is in the room?
- What's their background?
- What level of detail do they need?
- What language do they speak (technical? business? manufacturing?)

### Presenting to Leadership

**The Preparation:**
- Practice. Take it seriously.
- Do a dry run with a small audience if possible.
- Get feedback on clarity and length.

**The Self-Awareness:**
- If you talk fast when nervous → cut your content to accommodate
- If you talk slow when nervous → cut your content to accommodate
- Know your nervous habits and plan around them

**The Cardinal Rule:**
Be concise. Cut unnecessary detail that doesn't add value to THEM.

### The Emotional Investment Trap

**The Problem:** You've worked on something for 3 months. You're emotionally invested. You want to show everything.

**The Reality:** Leadership has 100 other things on their plate. They're not as emotionally invested in your thing as you are.

**The Risk:** You come off as out of touch and tone-deaf if you over-present.

**The Fix:**
- Be concise
- Show you respect their time
- Understand they don't need your level of detail
- Deliver exactly what they need to make a decision

### The Clear Ask Principle™

**One of the worst mistakes when presenting to senior leaders:**

You present a problem. Maybe even a solution. The senior leader asks: *"So what are you asking for? What do you want us to do?"*

...blank stare.

**Before presenting to leadership, know:**
- What are you hoping they will do in an ideal world?
- What decision do you need from them?
- What resources, support, or action are you requesting?

**Ask for what you WANT, not what you think you'll get.** You can negotiate down if they can't do it all. But if you under-ask, you leave value on the table.

### The Rambler's Cure

**If you know you ramble or over-explain:**

1. Practice the presentation with a small group
2. Get real, critical feedback
3. Stick to the script in the real presentation
4. Have someone signal you if you're going long

---

## 5.4 The Technical Translation Engine™

### The Core Skill

Translating technical complexity into language your audience understands.

**The Rule:** Knowing HOW to translate is only as good as knowing WHAT LANGUAGE THEY SPEAK.

### The Translation Approach

**Step 1: Identify their background**
- Manufacturing? Use factory/production language.
- Finance? Use ROI, cost, revenue language.
- Software? Use their technical language.
- General business? Use impact, timeline, risk language.

**Step 2: Connect to what they care about**
- Department heads care about resources and headcount
- Executives care about business outcomes and timelines
- Product owners care about features and customer impact
- Program managers care about schedules and dependencies

**Step 3: Translate accordingly**

### Translation Examples

| Technical Issue | Bad Translation | Good Translation |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Database performance regression | "The query optimization is causing N+1 problems in the ORM layer" | "Software delivery to the factory will be delayed by 2 weeks" |
| Technical debt slowing development | "We have significant coupling in our microservices architecture" | "New features are taking 3x longer than they should. We need to invest in cleanup." |
| Testing bottleneck | "Our CI/CD pipeline has insufficient parallel test execution" | "Can we get 3 more test engineers to help? We're behind on testing." |

### The Trust Principle

**Most of the time in senior-level conversations, technical details aren't super important.**

Senior leaders are trusting that:
- The SMEs (you) have analyzed the technical details
- There is legitimate risk or a real problem
- You've done the work before escalating

**They don't usually want to rehash all the technical details.** That's what you're getting paid for. They want to know:
- What's the impact?
- What do you need?
- What's the timeline?

### Matching Their Background

If you know a senior leader has:
- **Manufacturing background** → Use manufacturing language more
- **Software background** → You can use more technical language
- **Finance background** → Lead with numbers and ROI

**Always adjust to the audience.**

## 5.5 The Influence Without Authority Framework™

### The Core Challenge

Getting people who don't report to you—who don't share your resources or priorities—to give time and effort to help you achieve your goals.

**Without seeming like a pushy asshole.**

### The Buy-In Builder™

**The best way to get buy-in from peers who don't report to you:**

1. **Show the value**
   > "Wouldn't it be awesome if we could automate these tests? It would save your team time on all that manual testing downstream."

2. **Offer value in return**
   > "We could totally have someone on my team help you with that, since you're upstream of us—it'll save us time anyway."

3. **Make them part of the vision**
   > "If we pull this off together, we'll both look great and the company wins."

**The Principle:** At the end of the day, you're at a company that exists to make money. If you can convince people that your initiative will improve company performance and add tangible value, it's harder for them to shoot you down.

### The Social Credit Account™

**Concept:** Influence is like a bank account. You deposit social credit, and later you can withdraw it.

**How to deposit:**
- Do things for others with nothing asked in return
- Help people when you don't have to
- Share credit and recognition
- Be genuinely helpful and supportive

**How to withdraw:**
- Ask for help on your initiative
- Request resources from their team
- Need their time for your project

**The Rule:** You can't only withdraw. If you only take, people hate working with you. Keep the account in positive balance.

### The Anti-Politics Objection

**The engineer says:** "I shouldn't have to play politics."

**The reality:** If you're on the Accelerate path—trying to get promoted—politics and strategy are essential. That's often WHERE people get stuck. They can do the technical work, but they can't navigate the human dynamics.

**The reframe:** Politics doesn't have to mean dishonesty, sleaziness, or con-man tactics. You can play strategy and politics in a **moral and good way** that yields great results.

**If you refuse to play the game, you cap out.** That's the ceiling many engineers hit.

### The Honey Principle™

**When you have no authority, you must use honey to attract people.**

People need to WANT to do things for you. If you're:
- Pushy
- Bossy
- Stuck in your own view
- "Must be done my way"
- A jerk about it

...they won't. You have no leverage. They can just say no.

### The Flexibility Factor

**Don't be rigid on the HOW. Focus on the end goal.**

If you're recruiting people to help and they have a different approach:
- "Let's try it your way. If it doesn't work, we can adjust."
- Maybe their way works—great!
- Maybe you end up adjusting toward your original idea—also fine.

**You cannot influence without authority AND be pushy.** Pick one.

### The Credit Ladder

**Give credit and praise up the ladder—where it's due.**

**The trick:** Doing this without seeming like a kiss-ass.

**How:**
- Be genuine—only credit what's actually deserved
- Be specific—vague praise sounds hollow
- Include others—share credit broadly
- Be consistent—do it regularly, not just when you need something

---

## 5.6 The Executive Presence Blueprint™

### What Is Executive Presence?

It's not one thing—it's the overall impression you create. It's:
- How you show up in meetings
- How you carry yourself under pressure
- Whether people take you seriously
- Whether people would follow you

### The Seriousness Quotient

**You want to be serious most of the time.**

It's fine to be personable. You can start a meeting with "How was your weekend?" But:
- Don't let that take 10 minutes of a 30-minute meeting
- After 2 minutes, cut it: "Let's get into it."

**Why seriousness matters:**
- People follow others into battle who seem serious
- It shows you care about results
- It shows you respect everyone's time
- It shows you're passionate about making an impact

### Presence Killers

🔴 **Too much joking** — Makes you seem unserious

🔴 **Constant lightheartedness** — Same problem

🔴 **Being the naysayer** — Always criticizing company direction

🔴 **Complaining in group settings** — Airing grievances publicly

🔴 **Criticizing leadership publicly** — Undermines your image

**The Result:** People don't take you seriously. If they don't take you seriously, they won't follow you. If they won't follow you, you won't lead.

### The Say/Do Ratio™

**One of the most important metrics for executive presence.**

- Don't commit to more than you can do
- Do what you said you would do
- Get things done well and fast
- Move on to the next thing

**Having a reputation for:**
- Doing what you said you would
- Getting shit done
- Making things happen

...makes people want to follow you. This IS executive presence.

### The Blame/Credit Distribution

**A good leader:**
- Takes all the blame when things go wrong
- Gives all the credit when things go right

**Why this matters:**
- If you do this consistently, people look to you as a leader by default
- You can avoid arrogance by not verbally taking credit
- People know who did what—by deferring credit, you look BETTER

### Confidence vs. Arrogance

**The Line:**
- **Confidence:** Knowing your value, speaking with conviction, being decisive
- **Arrogance:** Talking about yourself, taking all credit, dismissing others

**Staying on the right side:**
- Highlight others' contributions
- Share credit broadly
- Stay humble about what you still need to learn
- Don't verbally claim credit for wins

---

## 5.7 The Managing Up Masterclass™

### The Core Principle

**Make your manager look good to THEIR manager, and they will be happy with you.**

### The No Surprises Policy

**Communicate bad news clearly and fast.**

Why:
- It can be addressed and prioritized
- Your manager isn't blindsided
- Problems can be accounted for in planning

**How:**
- As soon as you see risk, communicate it
- Don't wait until things blow up
- Good managers appreciate early warning

### The Wins Broadcast

**Send out wins in emails. Tag your manager. Maybe their manager if appropriate.**

This:
- Makes your manager look good (their team is delivering)
- Creates visibility for you
- Documents your contributions

### Common Mistakes with Managers

**Mistake 1: Not communicating bad news early**
- Waiting until it's too late
- Hoping problems solve themselves
- Blindsiding your manager

**Mistake 2: Challenging the HOW too much**
- Your manager asks you to do something
- You push back on how to do it
- Every ask becomes an argument

**The Distinction:**
- **Challenge the WHAT:** If the end result doesn't make sense, push back respectfully
- **Adapt to the HOW:** Try to match your manager's preferred approach

**The Risk:** If your manager feels like every ask will be a battle about HOW, they'll stop giving you high-value work. It'll go to someone easier to work with.

### The Weekly Wins Cadence

**Share wins with your manager weekly.**

- Have 1-on-1s weekly (bare minimum: every other week)
- Use this time for updates, wins, concerns
- Keep communication flowing

### Handling Problem Managers

**If your manager is absent, micromanaging, or unsupportive:**

1. Bring it up in a 1-on-1
2. Be specific about the behavior and impact
3. See how they respond

**If they:**
- Deny it, won't address it, seem stuck → Consider finding a new manager
- Want to work on it → You have a good manager who can change

### Disagreeing with Your Manager

**Do it respectfully. Never make it personal.**

**The Bad Way:**
> "I completely disagree with this and think it's wrong, but I'll do it just because you said to."

**The Good Way:**
> "I might not see things the way you do. Maybe your experience gives you an edge here. Let's try it your way—I hope it works."

**The Rule:** Ultimately, they're the manager. That's why they're the manager. Don't die on hills.

### The Headache Fixer Strategy™

**One of the most powerful managing-up tactics:**

Find out what your manager's biggest headaches are. Then fix them.

**How to discover headaches:**
- Listen in 1-on-1s for frustrations
- "Every time I want to see this data, I have to pull it manually..."
- They might mention things in passing—pay attention

**Then:**
- Build a script that automates it
- Create a tool that solves it
- Fix the problem they didn't ask you to fix

**This is HUGE.** You become invaluable.

---

## 5.8 The Difficult Conversations Framework™

### The Engineer's Challenge

Technical people often avoid difficult conversations because:
- They lack social experience
- They fear damaging relationships
- They don't know how to start
- They're conflict-averse

### Opening the Feedback Channel

**The Preemptive Declaration:**

Tell everyone—peers, manager, reports—that you actively seek critical feedback.

**The Script:**
> "If I find out 6 months from now that you had feedback you could have given me today—something that could have helped me improve—I'll be more upset that you didn't share it than I would ever be about hearing it now."

**Why This Works:**
- Takes away their fear about how you'll react
- Removes awkwardness on their end
- Opens the channel for you to give THEM feedback too
- Most people, if they give you feedback and you take it well, feel obligated to let you return the favor

### The Relationship Foundation

**Building strong working relationships beforehand makes everything easier.**

When you have a relationship:
- Giving feedback is less awkward
- Receiving feedback is less threatening
- There's context and trust

### The Balance Principle

**If you give recognition for positives AND constructive feedback for negatives, your negative feedback seems:**
- Authentic
- Balanced
- Not the only thing you ever say

**If you ONLY give negative feedback, you're seen as a critic, not a helper.**

### Giving Feedback to Strangers

Sometimes you need to give feedback to someone you don't work with regularly or have no strong relationship with.

**The Approach:**
1. Be polite
2. Preface: "This is honest work-related feedback. It's not personal. I'll state it as directly and precisely as possible."
3. Be relatable: Share that you had a similar issue, or have seen others overcome it

**Being relatable diffuses the blame feeling.** It's not "you're bad"—it's "this is common and fixable."

### Receiving Feedback You Disagree With

**Step 1: Wait to respond.**
Don't react immediately.

**Step 2: Internalize it.**
Sit with it. Play devil's advocate.

**Step 3: Assume they're right first.**
Start from the position that the feedback is correct. Then look for evidence it isn't.

**Step 4: Look for partial truth.**
Even if they're wrong overall, are there elements that are right? Does it trigger you to think of something related you DO need to work on?

**What NOT to do:**
- Knee-jerk "they're wrong and dumb and I'm great"
- Defensive posture
- Dismissing without consideration

**The Growth Mindset:** Always assume you have room to improve. Even "wrong" feedback might illuminate something you need to work on.

---

## 5.9 The Emotional Intelligence Upgrade™

### The Importance

Emotional intelligence is critical for promotion. The higher you go, the more you're managing people and relationships, not just technical problems.

### If You Truly Lack It

Some people genuinely lack emotional intelligence. If this is you:
- Read books and materials on it
- Get coaching or training
- Recognize it's a skill that can be developed

**The Insight:** If you're lacking EQ at work, you're probably lacking it outside work too. Start working on it everywhere.

### The Feedback Survey Approach

**Get feedback from people:**

**Option 1: Personal circle**
Talk to family, friends—people who can be honest with you. Ask them what you need to work on.

**Option 2: Work survey**
Send a survey to colleagues:
> "These are things I think I need to work on. Do you agree? Do you have others to add?"

**The Key:** You may not know what you don't know. External input is essential.

### The Empathy Factor

**Having empathy for managers is huge.**

Many ICs walk around thinking managers are:
- Greedy assholes
- Just barking orders
- Trying to squeeze more productivity

**The Reality:**
- Managers have huge pressure on them
- They have deadlines they need to meet
- They're accountable to higher-up managers
- They're often stressed and stretched thin

**Show that you:**
- Appreciate the pressure they're under
- Want to help them succeed
- Understand their constraints

**Result:** You start to get into their circle. They trust you more.

### Reading the Room

This ties back to **The Audience Awareness Principle™**.

**If you're not good at reading non-verbal cues:**
- Read verbal ones instead
- Don't do what others aren't doing
- Wait to see what leaders of the room do
- Follow their lead until you develop your own feel

**Over time,** you'll develop the instinct. But until then, observe and match.

# PHASE 6: THE MINDSET FORGE

We teach clients that tactics without mindset are like building on sand. The right mental foundation is what makes everything else work.

**The Core Truth:** Most engineers who get stuck aren't missing skills—they're trapped by limiting beliefs. This phase is about burning away what holds you back and installing what propels you forward.

---

## PART A: MINDSETS TO LOSE

These are the mental models that silently sabotage careers. They feel comfortable, even righteous. But they're anchors.

---

## 6.1 The "Hard Work = Reward" Fallacy™

### The Belief

"If I just put my head down, work hard, and deliver great results, I'll get promoted."

### The Reality

**I've seen so many engineers do exactly this.** They grind for 5-10 years, then look up confused: "Why haven't I been promoted?"

**Here's what happens:**
- You work hard but don't seek visibility
- You don't seem to care about advancement
- Management assumes you're happy where you are
- You like "being in the trenches"
- Over time, you get labeled "the X guy who loves that work"
- People assume you have no career aspirations

### The Math That Should Scare You

Think about a 30-40 year career:
- **Promotion every 8 years:** Maybe 4-5 promotions total
- **Promotion every 2-3 years:** 10-15+ promotions or level jumps

The difference in compensation, influence, and impact over a career is **massive**.

### The Poison of Bitterness

**I've seen people stuck in this position become bitter.** They poison other engineers with their resentment. They become hard to work with. Toxic for the team and organization.

**Don't become this person.**

### The Aha Moment

My aha moment was watching people close to me get promoted fast. I realized you can **dramatically cut the time to promotion** if you're intentional about it.

### The Culture Shift

Yes, you'll encounter people with the old mentality: "You need to put in your time."

But the culture is shifting. Senior leaders are getting younger. Managers are getting younger. **If you can prove you're at the next level, you can get to the next level.**

### The Exit Signal

If your company is very old-school—requiring "X years in Y position" before any promotion because you need to "pay your dues"—consider moving orgs or companies.

**You're setting yourself up for a slow slog to the top.** Life is too short for that.

### The New Belief

**Hard work is the prerequisite, not the differentiator.** Visibility and intentionality are what accelerate the timeline.

---

## 6.2 The "I Shouldn't Have to Self-Promote" Delusion™

### The Belief

"My work should speak for itself. Self-promotion is sleazy."

### The Reframe

Ask yourself: **Who cares about your career advancement more than you do?**

Maybe your grandma. But not anyone at work.

**This isn't evil or sleazy—it's human nature.** Most people are more interested in their own advancement than anyone else's. That's normal. That's okay.

### The Logic Chain

1. Hard work alone doesn't get you recognized (we established this)
2. You need visibility to get promoted
3. Who will be most committed to YOUR visibility?
4. **It should be YOU**

Nobody else will be as consistent, as emotionally invested, or as committed to your success as you should be. If someone else cares more about your career than you do, something is wrong with your mentality.

### The Positive Reframe

Don't think of self-promotion as sleazy politician behavior.

**Think of it as:**
- Making influential people aware of your abilities
- Getting visibility on the value you're adding
- Positioning yourself to have more influence
- Enabling yourself to add MORE value to the company

### The Virtuous Cycle

More visibility → More recognition → Promotion → More influence → More impact → More value to the company → Higher compensation

**That's not sleazy. That's fair.**

If you truly believe in your talents and the value you can add, you're just going to add MORE value if they give you more responsibility and broader influence.

### The Rules

✅ Be your own biggest advocate
✅ Make people aware of your genuine value
✅ Seek visibility intentionally

❌ Never misrepresent what you accomplished
❌ Never lie or be dishonest
❌ Never stretch the truth

**Honest self-promotion is not only acceptable—it's essential.**

---

## 6.3 The "Politics is Dirty" Misconception™

### The Belief

"I don't want to play politics. Politics is manipulative and dirty."

### The Reality

Politics is dirty **if you play dirty:**
- Lying
- Stretching the truth
- Harming others
- Slandering colleagues
- Manipulating people

**Politics itself is not inherently dirty.**

### The Reframe

Politics, done ethically, is simply:
- Getting visibility on your value
- Building relationships that matter
- Positioning yourself for more influence
- Playing the long game strategically

### The Choice

You can refuse to "play politics" and stay stuck. Or you can play strategically, ethically, and morally—and advance.

**The choice is yours.**

---

## 6.4 The "My Manager Should Notice" Fantasy™

### The Belief

"If I'm doing good work, my manager should notice and advocate for me."

### The Ideal vs. Reality

In an ideal world? Yes.

**But we don't live in an ideal world.**

### The Math of Manager Attention

Your manager is juggling things you don't see. You probably have visibility on maybe 20% of what they're handling.

Let's say:
- Your manager gives 20% of their time to managing people
- You're 1 of 15-20 direct reports
- You get 1/20th of 20% = **1% of your manager's attention**

**It's mathematically impossible** for your manager to be fully aware of all the value you're adding and the impact you're having.

### The Best Case

Even with a good manager who genuinely cares, they simply don't have the bandwidth to fully appreciate everything you're doing.

**This is why YOU need to tell them.** And their manager. And other managers.

### The Worst Case

You have a bad manager who literally doesn't care what you're doing. Coupled with bandwidth issues, you're completely invisible.

**This is why skip-level relationships and relationships with peer managers are so critical.**

### The Takeaway

Whether your manager is good or bad, you need to extend your visibility beyond them. On your own. Proactively.

---

## 6.5 The "Title/Years = Promotion" Antiquity™

### The Belief

"I've been here 5 years. I've paid my dues. I deserve a promotion."

### The Reality

This is old thinking. It's dying. And you need to let it go.

### The Analogy

You need your roof reshingled. One crew is half the price, but they're young. However, 10 neighbors used them and rave about the quality, professionalism, and results.

**Do you care that they're young?** No. Results matter.

### The Key

**Proving you have the value and skills to get to the next level.**

You need to convince managers you're ready—through evidence, track record, and demonstrated capability. Not by counting calendar days.

### Company Variation

Some companies are more old-school about this. It's a bigger hurdle, but not insurmountable. You just need:
- Stronger evidence
- Better track record
- More examples
- More convincing

If a company has a truly hard wall with defined time limits, consider leaving. You don't want to fight that battle every promotion cycle.

### The Real Danger

The biggest danger isn't the company's policy—**it's YOU buying into this logic.**

Don't:
- Mentally limit yourself
- Use "time in role" as a crutch when you don't get promoted
- Let the wind out of your sails
- Comfort yourself with "I just need more time"

**Get back on the horse. Keep pushing.**

---

## 6.6 The "I'm Just an IC" Limitation™

### The Belief

"I'm just an IC. I shouldn't be doing that / owning that / leading that."

### The Damage

The moment you say "I'm just an X," you've defeated yourself before the race starts.

### The Paradox

**The BEST way to prove you're ready for a promotion is to do the work at the next level BEFORE you have the title.**

If you limit yourself with "I'm just an IC," you can never do this by definition. You've eliminated your path to proving you're ready.

### The Opportunity

I have led meetings, initiatives, and task forces for things I "shouldn't" have had to own. No one was stepping up, so I stepped up.

**The result:**
- Helped me get promotions
- Rave reviews from VP and Director-level leaders
- Recognition and visibility I couldn't have gotten otherwise

### The Rule

Never limit yourself with "I'm just an X." You've given up before starting.

---

## 6.7 The "Companies Are Evil" Cynicism™

### The Belief

"Companies only care about money. We're all just cogs in the wheel. They don't care about us."

### The Damage

If you let this mentality seep in, you will never climb.

**Two reasons:**

1. **Externally:** People won't promote someone who trashes the company. You'll be seen as a naysayer, not a leader.

2. **Internally:** You won't give 100% to a company you think is just a shill. Your performance will suffer.

### The Mature Reframe

Yes, companies care about profits. That's why they exist. **This is a good thing.**

A company that doesn't pursue profits goes out of business. Then nobody has a job.

### The Mindset Shift

Decouple the belief that a company should be a family. Companies should be:
- Moral
- Ethical
- Fair

But a company's goal is to maximize value for shareholders. **That's not evil—it's the point of a company.**

The sooner you come to grips with this and make peace with it, the faster you'll succeed.

---

## 6.8 The Victim Mentality Trap™

### The Pattern

- "I applied 3 times and didn't get it"
- "My manager doesn't like me"
- "The cards are stacked against me"
- "It's not fair"

### The Guarantee

**When you give up and play the victim, you guarantee you won't get the promotion.**

### My Story

It took me **4 different applications and interview processes** to get my senior engineer role. Four.

If I had given up after the first, second, or third attempt, I wouldn't have gotten there.

### The Fuel Conversion

Every failed attempt is:
- Fuel for the next attempt
- A learning opportunity
- Data on what to improve
- Refinement for your next try

### The Fighter's Response

Even if:
- Your manager doesn't like you
- People seem against you
- Things feel unfair

**So what?**

Your options:
1. **Give up** → Get nowhere (guaranteed)
2. **Keep fighting** → Chance to overcome

Work harder. Prepare more. Prep better. Deliver more results. Add more value. **Make it undeniable that you deserve the promotion.**

### The Exception

If you're being harassed, bullied, or singled out unfairly, that's an HR issue. Handle it through proper channels.

### The Rule

Abandon victim mentality. Convert everything that would normally feed victimhood into fuel and learning opportunities.

**Always keep fighting.**

---

## PART B: MINDSETS TO GAIN

These are the mental models that accelerate careers. They may feel uncomfortable at first. But they're rocket fuel.

---

## 6.9 The Ownership Mentality™

### The Principle

Take on as much responsibility and ownership as your manager will allow.

### The Truth About Managers

**Your manager doesn't care about your title.** If they feel you can handle it, they will give you more responsibility.

All you have to do is ask.

### What to Ask For

- "Can I lead our standup?"
- "Can I run our team sync meeting?"
- "Is there something I can take off your plate?"
- "Can I own training and onboarding new team members?"
- "Can I coach the interns?"

**There is SO much room** to take on more responsibility without a title change.

### The Manager's Perspective

Every manager is looking for their team to:
- Do more
- Produce more
- With the same resources or less

If you're asking for responsibility, taking things on, and performing well—**you're a high performer primed for promotion.**

### The Mindset

Don't wait for responsibility to be given. Ask for it. Seek it. Absorb it.

---

## 6.10 The Value-First Mentality™

### The Principle

Always add value first. Before asking for anything in return.

### The Paradox

If you add value consistently, the return comes by itself—**even without asking.**

Sometimes even against your will.

### The Focus

Stop thinking: "What can I get?"

Start thinking: "What value can I add? How can I help?"

### The Trust

The return WILL come. Focus on value creation, and recognition follows.

---

## 6.11 The Long-Game Mentality™

### The Vision

You need a dream. A vision. What you want to accomplish in 5 years. 10 years.

**Keep that in view.**

### The Trade-Off

Does working 10% more now suck? Yes, of course.

But when you've gotten 2-3 promotions in 10 years, and you:
- Make 40-50% more money
- Have more responsibility
- Have more influence
- Can impact more things

**Will it be worth it?** Yes. If that's what you want.

### The Human Superpower

What makes humans unique is our ability to **pay a price today for a reward tomorrow.**

Don't get short-sighted. Don't expect immediate returns—in a day, a week, or a month.

### The Bank Account

Every investment you make in yourself and your career goes into a bank account.

**It's in the bank.** It's only a matter of time until you can withdraw it.

Maybe it's with this manager. Maybe another department. Maybe another company.

But it's in the bank. Don't forget that.

---

## 6.12 The Relationship Investment Mentality™

### The Seed Metaphor

View relationships as planting seeds.

**Different seeds produce fruit at different times:**
- Some in 2 months
- Some in 2 years
- Some in 20 years

Imagine you have a bag of mixed seeds and you don't know which one will produce fruit when.

**Is the solution to plant none?**

No. You plant as many as possible.

### The Unpredictability

Some relationships will bear fruit in:
- 1 day
- 1 week
- 1 month
- 5 years
- 10 years
- 30 years

**You can't predict it.**

### The Anti-Manipulation Rule

Don't build relationships with a manipulative mindset: "I'm building this one so in 1 year I can do X."

**No.** Just build them.

Always be building. As far and wide and deep as you can.

### The Math

You never know when your paths will recross with someone. You never know when a relationship will become beneficial.

**So plant as many seeds as you can. Everywhere. All the time.**

The more you plant, the more will be available to you over your career.

---

## 6.13 The Feedback Satellite Mentality™

### The Mode

Convince yourself that you are in **constant satellite receiving mode** for feedback.

Always scanning. Always open. Always processing.

### The Delusion to Abandon

Abandon any self-delusion that you are spectacular with minimal room to grow.

### The Tom Brady Principle

I once saw a video with Tom Brady—arguably the best QB who ever lived.

Mid-career. After winning multiple Super Bowls. A coach gave him a tiny, little tip.

Tom acted like he just now learned how to be a QB.

**To be the best, you have to always believe you have huge room to improve.**

### The Gratitude Shift

When someone gives you a way to improve, you should be:
- Thanking them
- Grateful

Not resentful. Not defensive.

### The Sensitivity Cure

Abandon sensitivity to feedback. Don't take it personally.

Just:
1. Internalize it
2. Apply what you can
3. Move on

### The Growth Source

We learn and grow FAR more from negative feedback than positive.

- Ask for it
- Make people know you want it
- Show you're comfortable with it

### The Side Benefit

People LOVE working with someone who:
- Has self-awareness
- Is open to critical feedback
- Can be coached and improved

They feel they can fix things with you. They feel safe working with you.

---

## 6.14 The Leader-Before-Title Mentality™

### The Principle

Take initiative and lead things—before you have the title.

### The Experience Loop

The more experience you get in leadership roles—even small ones:
- Taking notes in a meeting
- Steering a meeting along
- Owning a small initiative

The more confidence you build. The more people defer to you.

### The Vacuum

**Most people don't want to be the leader in a situation.**

Jump on it. Take the opportunity.

### The Muscle

The first time or two you'll fumble. You'll struggle through it.

That's fine. It's a muscle. You need to exercise it.

You WILL get better. Eventually you'll seem like a natural leader.

### The Perception Becomes Reality

When people see you as a leader, they treat you like a leader.

When they treat you like a leader, you become their leader.

**Perception creates reality.**

---

## 6.15 The Humble Student Mentality™

### Two Critical Mindsets

**1. Never think you're the smartest person in the room.**

Always assume you're the dumbest person there.

**Result:** By default, you now have something to learn and gain from every other person—no matter how big or small.

**2. Stop being afraid to look dumb.**

If you're afraid to look dumb:
- You'll never make mistakes
- If you can't make mistakes, you can't grow

### The Math

It's better to look dumb for 2 months, then pass everyone...

...than to try to "never look dumb" and stay dumb forever.

### The Release

Let go of ego protection. Embrace looking foolish temporarily.

**That's the price of growth.**

---

## PART C: THE IC TO MANAGER TRANSITION

The fundamental shifts required when moving from Individual Contributor to Manager.

---

## 6.16 The Accountability Elevation™

### The Fundamental Change

**You are now responsible and accountable to produce results.**

The buck stops with you.

### The New Reality

Telling your manager's manager "Well, we didn't get it done" is **not an acceptable answer anymore.**

This new load of responsibility and accountability is a huge bump up. It's usually eye-opening for first-time managers.

### The Shield Principle

Your team does their best work when you **shield them from pressure** and absorb it yourself.

If they're constantly stressed, they can't do their best work.

### The Thankless Nature

It's a thankless thing:
- You shield them from pressure
- You don't tell them how much you're absorbing
- They think there's no pressure
- You're quietly taking the hits so they can focus

**That's being a manager.** You take on a lot and don't get thanked for it. Sometimes no one even knows you're doing it.

Get used to it.

---

## 6.17 The Coach Transformation™

### The Fundamental Shift

You are no longer a first-line, hands-on doer.

**You're going from star player to coach.**

### The Mental Shift

You can't touch everything and do everything anymore. You are a coach.

Focus on **enabling others to do**, not micromanaging and doing the doing yourself.

### The Common Mistake

Most engineers take a while to figure this out when they become managers.

They keep trying to be the star player AND the coach. It doesn't work.

### The Outcome-First Approach

Ask your team to deliver what you WANT, but give them freedom on the HOW.

**Good:**
> "I need to be able to see progress on projects every day to know where we are."

Let them figure out how.

**Bad:**
> "I want you to make a dashboard that looks like this, using this tool, this color, these fields..."

### The Trust Requirement

The coach never subs in for the quarterback or running back in football.

If you don't trust the team to do what they need to do, it won't work. You can't do it for them.

**Better to let them fumble around a little and learn than to do it yourself.**

Know your role. Stick to it.

---

## 6.18 The Metrics Mindset™

### The New Requirement

You need to care about metrics a lot more as a manager.

**You must have a way to measure:**
- Is the team delivering results?
- Are we on track?
- Are we failing?
- Are we behind?

### The Danger of Gut Feel

You can't leave this to:
- Gut feel
- Casual comments in standups
- Vibes from sync meetings

You need to understand which metrics truly gauge success or failure—then track them closely.

### The Initial Resistance

The team won't like this at first. It feels like micromanagement.

### The Eventual Appreciation

When metrics get the team on track and delivering well, they start to appreciate them.

**Why?** Because metrics become objective truth and evidence that they're doing their jobs well.

Metrics shift from "surveillance" to "validation."

**That's a great place to be.**

---

## 6.19 The Relationship Recalibration™

### The Peer-to-Manager Dynamic

If you manage former peers, this is tricky to navigate.

**Handle it with:**
- Humility
- Grace
- Empathy
- BUT still authority

You ARE the manager. You ARE responsible and accountable. Don't forget that.

But be humble at the same time.

### The Complaining Rule

**One of the most off-putting things a manager can do: complain down.**

Never complain about things to people who report to you.

Never use 1-on-1s as venting sessions for yourself.

### The Perception Damage

Complaining down makes you seem:
- Amateur
- Weak
- Not a strong leader

**Complain UP. Vent UP. Never down.**

### The New Dynamic

You're a manager now. You can't interact with reports the same way you would with peers.

They need to:
- Trust you
- Believe you're a good leader
- Want to follow you into any situation
- Know you're strong, resilient, and have their back
- Know you'll go to bat for them

**Don't do things that make them question their faith in you.**

---

## 6.20 The Time Reallocation Protocol™

### Where Manager Time Goes

A new manager's time should go into:

1. **Enabling the team to succeed**
2. **Removing roadblocks**
3. **Ensuring people have the skills they need**
4. **Training when skills are missing**
5. **Building processes and practices for team success**

### The Reminder

**You are the coach, not the star player.**

Put your time into making the team function, operate, and execute better.

### The Trust Imperative

Trust the team to do the work.

The coach never subs in for the running back. If you don't trust the team, it won't work. You can't do it for them.

Better to let them fumble and learn than to do it yourself.

**Know your role. Stick to it.**
