        <h2><span class="emoji">📹</span> Video Format & Technical Requirements</h2>
        
        <h3>Recording Setup:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Horizontal/landscape (NOT vertical like TikTok)</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p minimum (most smartphones default to this)</li>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> 2-4 minutes ideal (max 5 minutes)</li>
            <li><strong>Format:</strong> MP4, MOV, or similar standard video format</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lighting & Audio:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural lighting:</strong> Face a window if possible, or use a well-lit room</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid backlighting:</strong> Don't have bright lights/windows behind you</li>
            <li><strong>Quiet space:</strong> Minimize background noise (no fans, AC, traffic)</li>
            <li><strong>Clear audio:</strong> Speak clearly and at normal conversational volume</li>
            <li><strong>Test first:</strong> Record a 10-second test to check lighting and sound</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Camera Position:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eye level:</strong> Camera should be at your eye level (stack books under laptop if needed)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Position yourself so your head and shoulders fill most of the frame</li>
            <li><strong>Centered:</strong> Keep yourself centered in the frame with a little headroom</li>
            <li><strong>Background:</strong> Clean, simple background (home office, living room, nothing distracting)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip">
            <div class="tip-title">💡 Pro Tip:</div>
            <p>Use your smartphone on a tripod or propped up securely. Phone cameras are usually better than laptop webcams! If using your phone, make sure it's in landscape mode.</p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2><span class="emoji">🎤</span> What to Talk About</h2>
        
        <p>Think of this as telling your story to a friend who's considering career coaching. Be natural, authentic, and conversational!</p>

        <h3>1. Where You Started (30-45 seconds)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your situation before coaching:</strong> What was your role? How long had you been there?</li>
            <li><strong>What you were struggling with:</strong> Job search not working? Interviews but no offers? Stuck in current role?</li>
            <li><strong>What made you decide to get coaching:</strong> What was the tipping point?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title">Example Opening:</div>
            <p>"I'm [Name], and I'm a [Your Engineering Discipline]. Before working with Mansour, I had been applying to roles for [X months] and was getting nowhere. I was sending out dozens of applications, getting maybe 1-2 interviews, but no offers. I was really frustrated and didn't know what I was doing wrong..."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. The Transformation (60-90 seconds)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What you worked on together:</strong> Resume? LinkedIn? Interview prep? Networking strategy?</li>
            <li><strong>What surprised you:</strong> What insights or changes made the biggest difference?</li>
            <li><strong>Specific examples:</strong> Did you rewrite your resume bullets? Learn how to network effectively? Practice behavioral interviews?</li>
            <li><strong>The turning point:</strong> When did you start seeing results? What changed?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title">Example Transformation Story:</div>
            <p>"Mansour completely rebuilt my resume using his Impact Bullet Formula. Instead of just listing my responsibilities, I was showing measurable results. We also worked on my LinkedIn strategy and how to network without feeling awkward. Within 3 weeks of implementing these changes, I started getting recruiter messages and interview requests. The quality of conversations completely changed..."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. The Results (45-60 seconds)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concrete outcomes:</strong> How many interviews? How many offers? Which companies?</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> How long did it take to see results?</li>
            <li><strong>Your SpaceX offer:</strong> This is huge—share the story! How did that opportunity come about?</li>
            <li><strong>Other opportunities:</strong> Mention the other interviews/offers you received</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title">Example Results:</div>
            <p>"After working with Mansour for [X weeks/months], I went from 0 interviews to multiple interviews with top-tier companies. I got offers from [mention 1-2 companies if comfortable], and ultimately accepted a role at SpaceX—which was literally my dream company. This was all within [X months] of starting the coaching program..."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>4. Who This Is For (30-45 seconds)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Who would benefit most:</strong> Engineers in similar situations to where you were</li>
            <li><strong>What makes it different:</strong> What did LaunchToLead offer that you couldn't find elsewhere?</li>
            <li><strong>Your recommendation:</strong> Would you recommend it? Why?</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title">Example Closing:</div>
            <p>"If you're an engineer who's been applying to jobs and not getting traction, or you're getting interviews but no offers, I can't recommend Mansour enough. This isn't generic career advice—it's a specific, proven system for engineers. The Launch Path gave me the exact tools and strategies I needed. Best investment I've made in my career."</p>

        <h2><span class="emoji">✅</span> Before You Record - Checklist</h2>
        
        <div class="checklist">
            <ul>
                <li>Test your lighting and audio with a 10-second recording</li>
                <li>Make sure your phone/camera is stable (tripod, stack of books, propped securely)</li>
                <li>Position camera at eye level in landscape/horizontal mode</li>
                <li>Check your background—clean and not distracting</li>
                <li>Review the talking points above so you remember what to cover</li>
                <li>Silence your phone notifications (or use airplane mode if recording on computer)</li>
                <li>Take a deep breath and be yourself—authenticity > perfection!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2><span class="emoji">💬</span> Tips for a Great Testimonial</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be conversational:</strong> Imagine you're talking to a friend, not reading a script</li>
            <li><strong>Use specific examples:</strong> "I got 5 interviews in 2 weeks" is better than "I got lots of interviews"</li>
            <li><strong>Show emotion:</strong> It's okay to show excitement about your SpaceX offer—that's a huge deal!</li>
            <li><strong>Don't worry about perfection:</strong> If you stumble or need to pause, that's fine—it makes it more authentic</li>
            <li><strong>Look at the camera:</strong> This creates "eye contact" with viewers</li>
            <li><strong>Smile naturally:</strong> Your energy and enthusiasm are contagious</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip">
            <div class="tip-title">⚡ Optional: Do Multiple Takes</div>
            <p>Feel free to record 2-3 versions and send me your favorite. Sometimes the second or third take feels more natural. But don't overthink it—your first authentic take is often the best!</p>
        </div>
