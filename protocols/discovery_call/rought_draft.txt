PART 1: THE DISCOVERY CALL PROTOCOL
Goal: Diagnose the problem, identify the correct Track, and guide the client to the appropriate Tier (Starter, Standard, or Premium). Duration: 15 Minutes (Hard Stop).
PHASE 1: PRE-CALL PREP (5 Minutes)
Do this before you get on Zoom.
1. Review Intake Form:
   * Job Title: Determines Track (Launch, Pivot, or Accelerate).
   * Hurdle: Note their specific pain point.
   * Seriousness: High scores (8-10) are good candidates for Premium. Low scores might be better for Starter/Standard.
2. LinkedIn Recon:
   * Tenure: How desperate is their situation? (Long unemployment = needs Premium urgency).
   * Quality: Is their current resume terrible? (Needs Starter basics). Or is it okay but they are failing interviews? (Needs Premium Mock Interview).
PHASE 2: THE CALL SCRIPT (15 Minutes)
1. The Frame (Minute 0-2)
"Hi [Name]. I’ve reviewed your application. We have 15 minutes, so I want to dive straight in. I see you rated your seriousness a [X]. Tell me, why is this a priority for you right now?"
2. The Diagnosis (Minute 3-8)
* Dig for the "Gap": "You mentioned [Hurdle]. Give me an example of how that stopped you this week."
* Identify the Missing Variable:
   * If they have no interviews: They have a Resume/Story problem. (Starter fixes this).
   * If they fail interviews: They have a Performance problem. (Premium fixes this).
   * If they are lost: They have a Strategy problem. (Standard fixes this).
3. The Prescription & Tier Selection (Minute 9-13)
"Based on what you said, you are a perfect fit for the [Insert Track] track.
I have three ways we can tackle this, depending on how much support you want:
* Option 1 (Starter): We just fix the foundation. I rewrite your resume/strategy, you execute on your own.
* Option 2 (Standard): We fix the foundation AND I help you build the specific tools (The Binder/Trojan Horse).
* Option 3 (Premium - Recommended): We do all that, PLUS I put you through a live simulation (Mock Interview/Negotiation) so you don't practice on real opportunities.
Given your goal to [Goal], I’d recommend [Standard/Premium] so we don't leave anything to chance. Which level feels right to you?"
4. The Close (Minute 13-15)
"Okay, great choice. The investment for that tier is $[Price]. I can get you onboarded for our kickoff call next Tuesday. Do you want to handle the invoice now to lock in the spot?"
