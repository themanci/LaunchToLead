# Warm Intro Protocol - Video Script Outline

**Video Length:** 5-10 minutes  
**Slides:** 8 total

---

## SLIDE 1: Title (30 seconds)

**On Screen:** "The Warm Intro Protocol™"

**Script:**
"Hey everyone, welcome to the Launch Method Classroom. I'm Mansour, and today we're covering the Warm Intro Protocol—one of the most powerful networking methods in the entire Launch Method.

This is the system that helped my clients turn alumni connections into actual job referrals. We're talking about going from a faceless PDF in a pile of 500 applications to being a real person that someone inside the company is vouching for.

Let's dive in."

## SLIDE 2: The Problem (45 seconds)

**On Screen:** "Cold applying = 1-2% response rate"

**Script:**
"Here's the harsh reality: when you cold apply to a job posting, you're competing with 500 other people. Maybe more. And your response rate? 1 to 2 percent if you're lucky.

You become a commodity. Just another resume in a massive pile that gets filtered by an ATS before a human ever sees it.

This is why the 'spray and pray' approach fails. You're not standing out—you're blending in with everyone else who's doing the exact same thing."

**[Pause for emphasis]**

## SLIDE 3: The Solution (1 minute)

**On Screen:** "Get someone INSIDE to lower the drawbridge"

**Script:**
"So what's the solution? Simple: get someone inside the castle to lower the drawbridge for you.

This is what I call the Trojan Horse Effect. When you build a genuine human connection with someone at your target company, they stop seeing you as 'Applicant #247' and start seeing you as a person they actually know and like.

And when a job opens up, they're not recommending some random stranger—they're recommending YOU. Someone they've talked to. Someone they trust.

This is how you differentiate yourself in a crowded market. You stop being a PDF and start being a person."

## SLIDE 4: The 4-Step Process (1.5 minutes)

**On Screen:** Steps 1-4 with numbers

**Script:**
"Alright, here's the exact 4-step process:

**Step 1: Identify.** Go to LinkedIn and use their Alumni tool to find 3 to 5 people from your school who now work at your target company. This is your warm network—people who already have a built-in reason to help you because you went to the same school.

**Step 2: Outreach.** Send them a low-friction connection request. And I'm going to give you the exact script in just a second.

**Step 3: The Call.** Once they accept, set up a 15-minute informational interview. You're not asking for a job—you're acting as a researcher gathering information about their experience.

**Step 4: The Pivot.** After you've built the relationship and provided value, this is where you can naturally pivot to asking if they'd be willing to refer you when a position opens up.

Notice we're building trust BEFORE we ask for anything. This is key."

## SLIDE 5: The Outreach Script (1.5 minutes)

**On Screen:** Full script displayed

**Script:**
"Okay, here's the exact message you should send. I want you to screenshot this or write it down:

[READ THE SCRIPT SLOWLY]

'Hi [Name], I'm a senior [Major] student at [School]. I see you're working at [Company]—I've been following their work on [Project] and would love to ask 2-3 questions about your experience there. No expectations, just looking for perspective from a fellow alum. Thanks, [Your Name]'

Now let me break down why this works, because every single word here is intentional."

**[Pause, then move to next slide]**

## SLIDE 6: Why It Works (1.5 minutes)

**On Screen:** Three reasons with bullet points

**Script:**
"There are three psychological triggers in this message that make it incredibly effective:

**Number one: Tribalism.** When you say 'fellow alum,' you're activating instant trust. You're part of the same tribe. You went to the same school. This lowers their guard immediately.

**Number two: Flattery.** You're asking for their advice, which validates their expertise. People LOVE to give advice. It makes them feel important and valued. You're stroking their ego in a genuine way.

**Number three: Low Friction.** The phrase 'no expectations' is crucial. You're removing any pressure for them to help you get a job. You're just asking to learn from them. This makes it psychologically easy for them to say yes.

When you combine all three of these elements, your response rate shoots up to 30 to 50 percent. Compare that to the 1 to 2 percent from cold applications."

## SLIDE 7: The Mindset Shift (1 minute)

**On Screen:** "You Are Not a Beggar"

**Script:**
"Now, I need to address the biggest mental block people have with this approach. They feel like they're begging for favors. They feel like they're bothering people.

Let me reframe this for you: You are NOT asking for a job. You are a RESEARCHER gathering data about the industry.

And here's the thing—most professionals actually WANT to help the next generation. They remember when they were in your shoes. You're giving them an easy, low-pressure way to pay it forward.

You're not a beggar. You're not a burden. You're giving them an opportunity to share their expertise and feel good about helping someone.

Shift your mindset, and this entire process becomes 10 times easier."

## SLIDE 8: Action Items (1 minute)

**On Screen:** Three action items + stat

**Script:**
"Alright, here are your action items for this week:

**Number one:** Find 3 to 5 alumni at your top 3 target companies. Use the LinkedIn Alumni tool—it's free and takes about 10 minutes per company.

**Number two:** Send that outreach script to at least 2 people. Don't overthink it. Just customize it with their name, company, and a project they're working on, then hit send.

**Number three:** Schedule your first 15-minute call this week. Get one conversation on the calendar. That's it.

Remember: when you personalize your outreach to alumni, you get a 30 to 50 percent response rate. That's 25 times better than cold applications.

This works. I've seen it work for dozens of my clients. Now go make it work for you."

## CLOSING (30 seconds)

**Script:**
"That's it for the Warm Intro Protocol. In the next lesson, we'll cover the Resource Activation System—how to leverage all the free resources your school already gives you that most students completely ignore.

If you have questions about anything we covered today, drop them in the comments section below this video. I read every single one and I'll answer them personally.

See you in the next lesson."

## DELIVERY TIPS:

1. **Pace:** Speak slightly slower than normal conversation. Give people time to process.

2. **Energy:** Match the content—be enthusiastic about the solution, serious about the problem, conversational during the script breakdown.

3. **Pauses:** Use strategic pauses after important points (especially after showing the script and before explaining why it works).

4. **Examples:** If you have a client success story about this method, drop it in Slide 3 or Slide 8.

5. **Screen Recording:** Consider recording your screen while showing the LinkedIn Alumni tool in action for Slide 4, Step 1.

6. **Call to Action:** End strong with the action items—make them feel like they can do this TODAY.
