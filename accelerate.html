                    <h3>How do I know if I'm ready for promotion?</h3>
                    <p>If you're consistently delivering strong results but not getting promoted, you're likely missing visibility, positioning, or strategic relationships—not performance. That's exactly what I help with.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if my company doesn't have clear promotion paths?</h3>
                    <p>Many don't! We'll work to understand informal promotion criteria, build relationships with decision-makers, and create your own path forward.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you guarantee I'll get promoted?</h3>
                    <p>I can't control your company's decisions, but I can give you the exact frameworks and strategies that drove my 4 promotions. You'll have a clear action plan and know exactly what to execute.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I'm great technically but struggle with visibility?</h3>
                    <p>Perfect! That's the most common gap. I'll show you how to communicate impact, build relationships, and get noticed without feeling inauthentic or "salesy."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How is this different from my manager's mentorship?</h3>
                    <p>Your manager is invested in your current role. I provide an outside perspective, industry best practices, and frameworks from someone who's navigated rapid promotion cycles successfully.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I want to move into management but have no experience?</h3>
                    <p>I made that exact transition! We'll develop your leadership skills through IC work, find opportunities to demonstrate leadership, and position you for your first official role.</p>
