Summary
I bridge the gap between engineering design and field ready power
solutions. With a background in Electrical Engineering and hands on
experience in utility scale power systems, I specialize in translating
technical requirements into reliable, build ready protection and
control solutions.I have worked across the full lifecycle of relay
panels and control enclosures, from engineering intent through
manufacturing and final validation. My work focused on developing
and refining AC and DC schematics, wiring diagrams, and panel
layouts to meet the technical, safety, and quality requirements
of utility and renewable energy customers. I played a key role
in Functional and Final Acceptance Testing, verifying system
behavior, identifying issues early, and ensuring solutions were
validated prior to delivery.I approach engineering with a strong
applications mindset. I am driven by understanding why a system
is designed a certain way and how product and configuration
choices impact reliability, safety, and long term performance. I enjoy
working at the intersection of engineering, product application, and
customer engagement, helping stakeholders navigate technical
specifications, evaluate solutions, and make informed decisions
aligned with operational and business goals.Core competencies
include• Protection and Control Systems including relay panels,
control enclosures, AC and DC schematics• Validation and Testing
including Functional Acceptance Testing, troubleshooting, and
quality verification• Applications Engineering including technical
consultation, specification review, and solution alignment• Industry
Standards and Practices including utility scale power systems,
renewables, NEC, and IEEEI am seeking Applications Engineering
or Technical Sales Engineering roles within OEMs, utilities, EPCs,
or power infrastructure organizations where engineering judgment,
product expertise, and customer trust drive long term success.
