"Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning." -William Arthur Ward






Drivetrain Embedded Software Engineer . . . . . . . . Oct ‘19 – May ‘20
-Implemented measured direction and output shaft speed logic for 8R IVT tractors in embedded C, following system requirements and maintaining consistency with legacy projects — validated through virtual CAN tools (CANalyzer, FVIO, TractorSim) and deployed to 12 base tractor configurations for production.
-Improved rear PTO clutch protection by changing torque estimation run rate from every 10 seconds to every 60 seconds — validated through SIL and HIL testing.
-Reduced engine DTC false alarms on 5M tractors by editing the CHASSIS controller unit option script to include Stage 5 emissions four-cylinder applications in AC compressor CAN messaging.


Controls Continuous Improvement Software Engineer . . . . . . . Mar ‘19 - Oct ‘19 
-Built experimental software to resolve aftertreatment regen issues and relieve a warehouse hold — in under 2 days — by navigating complex base code conversion and hybrid AT setup across multiple teams, expediting release and unblocking 10 machines worth $10M from shipping.
-Presented the software emissions de-tier release process to 20 DTAC coworkers, establishing alignment between DTAC and Controls — decreasing payload release turnaround time by 15–20% and reducing miscommunication-driven rework.
-Implemented software patch for variable geometry turbochargers affecting 11 software codes and 5 ECU series, improving failed learn detection while eliminating the need for a field technician visit — saving dealer service calls, warranty and labor costs.
-Eliminated nuisance DTCs causing customer dissatisfaction on 8R tractors through deep root cause analysis of software DTC-enabling history
-Introduced a new OneNote-based standup format capturing project milestones, ownership, and priority — eliminating ambiguity in task responsibility and repeat communication across 5 team members, adopted as the team's permanent standup workflow.


PVV Mechanical Development Engineer . . . . . . . . May ’18 - Mar ‘19
-Decreased post test data processing time 75% by writing 10 scripts in VBScript (DIAdem) and Python — turning hours of manual data extraction into automated workflows used by 6+ test engineers.
-Created a software request tool for Test Engineers to streamline payload ordering, coordinating with Tech Leads to define requirements — reducing payload lead time by 40% and eliminating 1-2 incorrect payload incidents per quarter that had previously caused 1-2 weeks of wasted test time.
-Verified injector nozzle failure risk for a torque increase on 4-cylinder 4.5L tractors using heat-sensitive nozzles and thermocouple-instrumented injectors — avoiding interruption to multi million dollar European small utility tractor market.
-Audited emissions for 3-cylinder 2.9L engines from the India factory by running CHET and RMC cycle tests, confirming NOx and PM levels within acceptable range with engine hours remaining below 50 — ensuring compliance with emissions regulations to keep production in India uninterrupted.
-Introduced 5 PV&V Tech Lead training sessions for 8+ new engine engineers, coordinating presenters and curriculum across 5 key engine systems — reducing new engineer ramp-up time by ~15%.
