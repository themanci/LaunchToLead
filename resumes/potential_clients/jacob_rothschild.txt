UNIVERSITY PROJECTS
Interactive Pumpkins
Project Lab 2 Project
August 2022-October 2022

Designed pumpkins that responded to a human's facial expression using Raspberry Pis with a team of students
Generated embedded software for the Raspberry Pi, in Python, to detect a human's facial expression and respond to the expression using the OpenCV and DeepFace libraries
Co-led the project management for the project
Initiated the software architecture by designing a flowchart, which reduced errors and saved the team over 5 hours

Robocop
Project Lab 1 Project
January 2022-May 2022

Learned how to program a FPGA in Verilog rapidly in 1 month; thereafter, programming a rover chassis to follow a metallic path in Verilog using a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA and inductive proximity sensors
Incorporated Verilog to program a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA enabling the system to display different characters on a seven-segment display to respond to specific blinking LED signals, enhancing functionality and user experience
Implemented a Verilog module to have the system shoot a rubber band at the target if the system detected a blinking red LED
Led a collaborative effort to validate that each component fit together smoothly and combined sections at a time; as a result, streamlined processes, reduced errors, and saved the team over 10 hours

WORK EXPERIENCE
Universal Tech Movement
Software Engineer Intern
February 2025-June 2025

Debugged and optimized Python scripts to extract job information from our sponsor's job boards by implementing multiprocessing, resulting in 50 plus hours saved annually
Made code more maintainable resulting in 10 plus hours of time savings for future updates
Optimized Python scripts to summarize job descriptions, through OpenAI's API, only on new or updated postings, cutting annual costs by approximately 97%
Launched a website to post the jobs extracted from the Python scripts via a WordPress template, modifying the HTML, CSS, and PHP code as necessary
