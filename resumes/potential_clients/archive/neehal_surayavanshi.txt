WORK EXPERIENCE
Solved Engineering, San Diego, CA
Engineering Intern
May 2024 - Aug 2024

Computed per-unit-length capacitance (C), capacitive susceptance (B), and positive-sequence impedance (Z1) for underground HV cable systems using conductor geometry, insulation properties, and sheath/ground return paths documented assumptions and intermediate calculations for peer review.
Produced separate sequence-network impedance diagrams (positive/negative/zero) from line-cable parameters and transformer data to support fault and power-flow studies.
Used CYMCAP to evaluate worst-case steady-state ampacity and conductor temperature under project-specific laying conditions (soil thermal resistivity, backfill, duct bank geometry, spacing, ambient/load factors); compared results against thermal and insulation limits.
Performed Pull-Planner analyses to verify constructability—calculated maximum pulling tension and sidewall pressure vs. manufacturer limits across conduit segments, bends, and proposed pulling directions.
Built Excel calculators for FR voltage-drop and percent-regulation across proposed cable lengths and loading; added flicker/step-change checks and parametric inputs for quick "what-if" runs.
Completed services worksheet by extracting and validating square-footage figures from plan sets to feed downstream load and capacity summaries.
Assisted with job-package assembly (drawings, calculation sheets, and material lists) to support internal QA and external submittals.

ACADEMIC PROJECTS
HVDC in the Midwest - Senior Design Project
Feb 2025 - Dec 2025

Planned an HVDC corridor as a supplemental/alternative to the MISO Tranche 2.1 HVAC build-out, defining terminal interconnection buses, corridor options, and transfer targets.
Led PSS/E AC load-flow studies, built/validated base cases, enforced area/zone interchange balance, monitored thermal ratings, and maintained bus voltages within 0.95-1.05 p.u.; produced exception reports for overloads and off-nominal voltages.
Ran N-1 contingency screens on lines/transformers, examined reverse-power impacts on neighboring areas, and quantified reactive margin requirements (generator Q-limits, shunt support, LTC effects).
Contributed to a comparative cost/reliability study—qualitatively assessing converter sites, ROW footprint, circuit-mile reduction, and grid-reliability benefits vs. HVAC alternatives.

Power System Reliability Analysis
Nov 2025 - Dec 2025

Modeled and analyzed a 17-bus transmission system under multiple load scenarios and contingency conditions.
Performed N-1 and N-2 contingency analyses, identifying and resolving voltage/generation violations through capacitor placement and generator redispatch.
Optimized system performance, reducing losses from 5.8% to acceptable limits while maintaining voltage stability.

AC Power Flow Analysis & System Modeling
Nov 2023 - Dec 2023

Engineered power flow solution, configuring slack, PV, and PQ bus types while optimizing convergence algorithms for accurate load distribution analysis.
Developed Y-bus admittance matrix algorithm in MATLAB, incorporating series/shunt impedances, per-unit transformations, and transformer tap adjustments.
Cross-validated MATLAB computations with PSS/E outputs, achieving computational accuracy and creating visualizations for power distribution analysis.
